{"result": " Golden Retrievers, a popular breed known for their friendly and affectionate nature, are statistically at a significant risk of developing cancer throughout their lifetimes. Specifically, the estimated lifetime risk for two common types of cancer in this breed is high. These types include hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma. It's important to note that while the exact prevalence may vary slightly between sources, both descriptions indicate a substantial risk for these cancers in Golden Retrievers. Regular veterinary check-ups and early detection can help improve the prognosis for affected dogs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
