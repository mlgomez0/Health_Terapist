1. **Active Listening**: When you're with your partner, focus on really hearing what they're saying. This means putting aside distractions, maintaining eye contact, and responding in a way that shows you understand their feelings.


2. **Reflective Communication**: After your partner speaks, try to reflect back what you've heard. This can help ensure you've understood them correctly and shows that you're engaged in the conversation.


3. **Emotional Awareness**: Take some time to understand your own emotions. This self-awareness can help you respond more thoughtfully in your relationship.

my depression has been reoccurring for a long time it all started when i was being bullied in high school in ninth grade my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that was not the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though i am not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if it is not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i would not be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones,"I'm truly sorry to hear that you've been going through such a challenging time.

It's understandable that discovering something unexpected in a long-distance relationship can be unsettling.

3. Use ""I"" statements to communicate your emotions, such as ""I felt surprised and concerned when I saw the texts.""
4. Ask open-ended questions to encourage your partner to share their perspective, like ""Can you help me understand the nature of your relationship with your coworker?""
5. Listen actively to their response, and try to understand their point of view.

i have been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it i have not been diagnosed with depression but i have been extremely sad for years how can i deal with being bullied at school when the teachers will not help,"I'm truly sorry to hear that you've been going through such a tough time. It's understandable that you're feeling sad given the situation. Dealing with bullying can be incredibly challenging, especially when it feels like there's no support from those who are supposed to help.


Here are some steps you might consider:

It sounds like you're facing a challenging situation with your apartment manager. It's important to know that having an emotional support animal (ESA) can be beneficial for managing anxiety and depression, and it's great that you have the documentation.


Since you've encountered a setback, it might be helpful to reach out to your apartment manager again to explain the situation and the importance of the ESA for your mental health. Sometimes, a conversation can lead to a better understanding. If that doesn't work, you might want to look into local housing laws regarding ESAs, as there may be specific regulations that you can reference.


In the meantime, there are other ways to support your well-being. You could explore local support groups for individuals with anxiety and depression, which can provide a sense of community and shared experience. Additionally, engaging in regular physical activity, mindfulness practices, and hobbies can also contribute positively to your mental health.


Remember, it's crucial to have a support system in place, so don't hesitate",agree with the apartment managers viewpoint that your disability is not a physical limitationask the manager if they would accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnosis emotional disabilitiesif the answer is yes then find a therapist who is willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapists terms of working with you to compose such a letterif the manager tells you no then find out who is above this person or entity and find out how to formally introduce your request to the board or apartment owner or whoever actually is the legal owner of the building

As for atoning for your actions, it's admirable that you're considering ways to make amends. While it's true that we can't control the actions of others, focusing on positive actions can help improve your own sense of well-being. Keeping up with your random acts of kindness is a wonderful way to contribute positively to the world around you.

They can help you navigate these emotions and find constructive ways to move forward.

how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has i have read about this online but i would like to understand this from a therapists point of view,"Therapists often use personality assessments to understand their clients better, and one of the most recognized frameworks is the Five Factor Model, also known as the Big Five. This model looks at five key dimensions of personality:


1. Openness to Experience: This trait features characteristics such as imagination, insight, and a wide range of interests.

2. Conscientiousness: This dimension includes high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviors.

3. Extraversion: Extraverts are sociable, assertive, and tend to gain energy from social situations.

4. Agreeableness: This trait reflects attributes like trust, altruism, kindness, and affection.

5. Neuroticism: Individuals with high levels of neuroticism may experience mood swings, anxiety, irritability, and sadness.


Therapists consider these characteristics to understand their clients' behaviors, preferences, and challenges. However, it's important to remember that personality is complex and multifaceted, and these traits are just",that is a great question there is such a wide range of ways to define personality that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality typesthat being said some clinicians will use standardized tests or assessments to assess a clients type of personality while these tests cannot tell us everything about a person they can help us understand where we are within larger groups of different personality stylessome counselors will also use a diagnostic tool like the dsm or icd to help a client understand a diagnosis that is related to a personality disorder

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically decides to end counseling sessions or terminate the working relationship with a client based on several factors. The primary goal is always the well-being and best interest of the client. Here's a general outline of considerations:


1. **Client's Progress:** Counselors assess the progress of their clients. If a client has achieved their therapeutic goals or has made significant progress, it might be time to consider concluding the sessions.


2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor evaluates if the client feels ready to continue without the regular support of sessions. This includes the client's ability to cope with challenges independently.


3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** The quality of the therapeutic relationship is crucial. If the relationship has become strained or is not beneficial for the client, a counselor might suggest termination.

Deciding on relationships can be very challenging, and it's okay to seek guidance. However, I can't provide specific advice on relationships. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to speak with a counselor who can offer support and help you explore your feelings in a safe space. Remember, your well-being is the most important thing.",previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so i would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topic when you ask yourself this question it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far relationships require time and work for them to develop grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners this is a key factor reciprocity without both of you sharing the same core values beliefs expectations and lifestyles without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood protected cared by supported and loved by each other there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run what has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run many people focus too much on looks financial benefits or other external factors which are important but cannot build a healthy mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship this does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities what they ignore is that with time life challenges issues and pain temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined be honest with yourself reflect on what you truly need want and expect from a boyfriend and life partner ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you so while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner the other could feel frustrated or just not truly fulfilled passionate or happy with herhis partner longterm relationships require a lot and when i talk about sharing same core factors i mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical mental emotional and spiritual levels and around all the other roles life involves related to lifestyle as social life habits dreams preferences etcthen there is a lot to reflect on by yourself to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person if you feel you do then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way in a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that as another counselor suggested out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work if your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone by themselves thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives to bring some feelings of happiness and company the problem is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling unless the person works on herselfhimself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship finally i want to mention what i shared in a past article on this subject namely you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions otherwise lack of honesty accountability andor respect would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships also we are all human beings and that means we are no perfect and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves without manipulation neglect or abuse thus while on one hand healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses on the other hand it is fully incompatible with tolerating andor enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves this is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary without this it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time they would not they would just get worse so let us take one step at a time reflect on what you feel need and want now and for the future assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better if professional support is needed and both are willing to take it please do not delay it if one refuses necessary support then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you trust more actions than words set and keep healthy boundaries and take into account what life experiences show you as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial biased or too rushedthank you for sharing
i am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the united states i faced a cultural shock and i was so depressed when i arrived here my counselor in the university was my savior he helped me a great deal now i am going back to my country for a vacation i was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and i remembered that he likes wine my country is known for that is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after christmas,"I can hear how much you've been through, and it's wonderful that you found a counselor who's been so helpful to you. It's thoughtful of you to consider a gift that reflects his interests. Wine could be a nice gesture, especially if it's from your country, as it can be a symbol of your culture and appreciation. However, it's important to remember that gifts should come from the heart and not be tied to expectations. If you're comfortable with it, perhaps you could also include a heartfelt note expressing your gratitude for his support. Remember, though, that while gifts can be a way to show appreciation, the most valuable gift you've given him is your trust and the progress you've made together.",this is a great question in general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients there are some exceptions to this general rule including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift givingit might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings you could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriatein the end i know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"Counselors typically decide to end counseling sessions or terminate their working relationship with a client based on several factors. It's important to note that this decision is made with the client's best interests in mind, ensuring their well-being and progress.

1. **Client's Goals and Progress:** A counselor will assess whether the client has achieved their stated goals or if there are new goals that can be set. If the client has made significant progress and feels confident in managing their challenges, it might be time to consider ending the sessions.

2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor will evaluate if the client feels ready to continue without regular sessions. If the client feels they have gained enough skills and support to handle their situation independently, the counselor may suggest a termination plan.

3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** The strength and quality of the therapeutic relationship between the counselor and the client play a crucial role. If the relationship has developed positively and the counselor believes the client can maintain it without ongoing sessions, they may consider termination.

4. **Client'",for a therapist deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision one that is not entered into lightly while there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question i will offer an example of two areas that counselors take into consideration when ending counseling sessionsdoes the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide this requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is neededand has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goals while this question is specific to the counselor i would like to also add that a client at any time can end counseling

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"As a mental health assistant, I would respond:


""It's great that you're seeking to understand the counseling process better. Counselors typically decide to end counseling sessions or terminate their working relationship with a client based on several factors. These can include the achievement of the client's goals, the client's readiness to continue without the counselor's support, or the counselor's professional judgment that the client has reached a plateau in their progress. However, it's important to note that this decision is always made with the client's best interest in mind, ensuring they have the necessary tools and support to continue their journey towards well-being. If you're considering ending counseling, it's a good idea to discuss this with your counselor to understand their perspective and to plan the next steps together.""",it is usually time to end counseling sessions when it is clear to both the client and the counselor that therapeutic goals have been reached and enough improvement has been made that the client can continue without that support there are exceptions to this rule but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination for some clients this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties for some other clients however this is a difficult process in which they are losing a valuable support and are understandably anxious about what life will be like without the frequent meetings ultimately termination is different for everyone and there are many ways that termination can be healthy and helpful

how does a person start the counseling process,"I'm glad you're reaching out about starting the counseling process. It's a positive step towards taking care of your mental health. To begin, you can look for a licensed therapist or counselor in your area. You can do this by checking with your insurance provider for covered professionals, or you can search online for therapists who specialize in the issues you're facing. When you find a few you're interested in, you can reach out to them to schedule an initial consultation. This meeting will give you a chance to discuss your needs and see if you feel comfortable with them. Remember, taking this step is a sign of strength, not weakness. How are you feeling about starting this journey?",hello counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it does not have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worthonce you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselorin the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous here is a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor it is true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we are standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy

my brother just broke up with his girlfriend while they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother now she does not think her son should have any interaction with us how should we approach the situation is she doing the right thing for her child,"I'm truly sorry to hear about the situation with your brother and his girlfriend.

Firstly, it's essential to ensure the child's emotional well-being is a priority. You might consider having a calm and gentle conversation with your brother to express your concerns for his son's feelings. It's possible that the child may not fully understand the situation, and it might be beneficial for him to have a conversation with his mother, if she's open to it, to express his feelings in a safe and controlled environment.


However, please remember that as a mental health assistant, I cannot advise on legal matters. It might be helpful to suggest that your brother seeks guidance from a family counselor who can facilitate a conversation between all parties involved.


If you feel the child's well-being is at risk, it's crucial to reach out to child protective services for advice. But remember, this is a sensitive issue, and it's best handled with the help of professionals.


And again",hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him he is a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her will not likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well

Effective communication is key to nurturing positive relationships. Here are a few strategies you might find helpful:


1. **Active Listening**: Make a conscious effort to listen to understand, not just to respond. This means giving your full attention, acknowledging what the other person is saying, and responding thoughtfully.


2. **Empathy**: Try to put yourself in the other person",staying present is an attitude most of us aspire to and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first i am here to tell you that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn unfortunately the only way to do it is to do it what a paradox but there are plenty of other skills that we are not born with walking on stilts riding a bike swimming and driving a car are good examples you cannot learn them by reading about themhaving said that i can recommend two books on the subject eckhart tolles the power of now and david richos when the past is present richo asks that we do not beat ourselves up about dwelling on past events this is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinished business but while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits ushe offers three helpful steps to making any important life changestep one hold in awareness the behavior belief attitude or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you want to be different awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingstep two live as if you have already made the change this is hard and takes courage but you can do it ride that bikeeven if for a foot or twostep three be persistent practice practice practicejust as twoyearolds are able to walk confidently after hundreds of hours of practice you will be able to stay in the here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many many times
every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather how can i fight this,"I'm really glad you've reached out to talk about this. It's completely normal to feel down during the winter months for some people, as the lack of sunlight can affect our mood. One way to combat this is by making sure you're getting enough natural light during the day, even if it's just a few minutes outside. Additionally, staying active and maintaining a routine can be very helpful. Engaging in indoor activities that you enjoy, like hobbies or exercise, can also lift your spirits. If you find that these feelings persist and start to interfere with your daily life, it might be beneficial to speak with a mental health professional who can provide you with personalized strategies to cope with seasonal changes. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there's support available.",sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp to boost your dose of vitamin d when the sun is not naturally out also consider what is it that the change in weather changes in your life if for example when its sunny you are an outdoorsy active person and when the weather changes you are whole activity level changes along with it you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months
i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i do not know how what can i do,"I'm really glad to hear that you're ready to face your fears and work towards overcoming them. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the things that scare us. To start, you might consider identifying the specific fear you're dealing with. Once you know what it is, you can take small steps towards it. For example, if it's a fear of public speaking, you could begin by speaking in front of a mirror, then to a small group of friends, and gradually increase the audience size as you feel more comfortable. Remember, it's okay to go at your own pace. If you'd like, I can also suggest some resources for professional guidance or support groups where you can share your experiences with others. How does that sound?",fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance i will use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said i am scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c

It's completely understandable to feel this way when you notice changes in someone's behavior, especially when it involves their communication patterns. It's important to approach this with openness and without jumping to conclusions. Perhaps you could express your feelings to the person involved in a calm and non-confrontational manner. It might help to let them know you've noticed these changes and that you're there to support them. Remember, it's okay to seek guidance from a professional if you're feeling overwhelmed.",a rare topic likely extremely troublesome for you i would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight feel free to email mei would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong
how can i know if i am just being paranoid,"I hear you, and it's really important that you're reaching out about your feelings.

1. **Client's Progress:** Counselors assess the client's progress towards their therapeutic goals. If the client has achieved the goals set at the beginning of therapy or has made significant progress, the counselor may suggest concluding the sessions.

2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor evaluates the client's readiness to continue therapy or to end it. If the client feels prepared to manage their issues independently or has no further need for therapy, the counselor may consider termination.

3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** The strength and quality of the therapeutic relationship play a crucial role. If the counselor and client have developed a strong rapport and trust, the counselor may feel confident in suggesting the end of therapy.

4. **Client's Request",there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things do not seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor follows through
i am a female and in my early teens i do not want to feel afraid of people when i meet someone i know that they are okay but i still feel afraid,"I'm really glad you reached out to talk about this, and I want you to know that it's completely okay to feel a bit apprehensive when meeting new people. It's a natural part of growing up and making new connections. Sometimes, these feelings can be heightened, especially when we're in new situations or around people we're not as familiar with.


It's great that you recognize that the person you're meeting is okay, as this is a positive step in feeling more at ease. Here are a few suggestions that might help you feel more comfortable in social situations:

- Start by focusing on common interests or activities you both enjoy. This can be a great conversation starter and a way to connect on a deeper level.

- Practice mindfulness or deep-breathing exercises before meeting new people. These techniques can help calm your nerves.

- Consider joining clubs or groups that align with your interests. Being around people with similar passions can make interactions feel more natural.

If you find that these feelings persist or become overwhelming, it might be helpful",maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other peoplereflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trustif you have had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be fearedgive yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed
i have gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,"It's completely normal to feel nervous and shaky when starting therapy, as it's a new experience and you're stepping out of your comfort zone. These feelings can be part of the process as you're learning to express yourself and work through emotions. However, if these feelings persist or become overwhelming, it might be helpful to discuss them with your therapist. They can provide you with strategies to manage these emotions and make your sessions more comfortable. Remember, therapy is a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.",hi there thank you for your question it is absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist

It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.


It's understandable that you wanted to help your exboyfriend's friend, especially since he helped you with your depression. However, it's also crucial to respect boundaries and consent. It sounds like he may have felt overwhelmed by your actions, which is a valid reaction. Everyone has limits on what they can handle, and it's essential to recognize and honor those limits.


You're not in the wrong for wanting to help someone in need, but it's also important to approach such situations with care and sensitivity. Perhaps, in the future, you could reach out to the friend directly, if it's safe and appropriate, or encourage him to seek professional help.


Remember, you've taken a brave step by acknowledging your feelings and reaching out for support. It's okay to feel upset about the situation, and it's important to process",your compassionate reach out to the friend is praiseworthythat your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearlyi believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your actionhowever he is mixing up his own responsibility to know the root of his feelingsblaming you for feelings he does not understand within himself is unfair and not helpful to anyone including himfrom what you write you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was graciousmy only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior is that he does not yet fully understand himself and finds blaming others easier than understanding himself

Firstly, it might be helpful to establish a routine that includes time for relaxation and activities you enjoy. This can create a sense of balance. Mindfulness exercises and deep-breathing techniques can also be effective in managing anxiety in the moment.


Additionally, consider discussing your workload with your supervisor. It's possible that they might not be fully aware of the impact it's having on you. If you're comfortable, you could suggest setting more realistic expectations or discussing a more equitable compensation for your contributions.


Remember, it's also okay to seek support from friends, family, or a professional counselor who can provide you with personalized strategies to cope with stress. Your mental health is incredibly important, and taking steps to care for it is always worthwhile.",recognize your reason for continuing to work for this placesometimes overworked and underpaid is tolerable because of the valuable learning which the person will take with them when they have decided the time has come for these lessons to endor are you in this place because it is an easy commute to your home or fits well with other parts of your life such as education or some health related programas long as you have a good reason to be there you will feel there is good purposeif there is no good purpose and every day you wake up to work for a place you cannot stand then its time to look for a new position
how does a person start the counseling process,"I'm glad you're reaching out about this. Starting the counseling process is a positive step towards taking care of your mental health.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor may decide to end counseling sessions or terminate their working relationship with a client based on several factors. It's important to understand that this decision is made with the client's best interest in mind. Here are some considerations that might lead to this decision:


1. **Client's Progress:** If a client has consistently made progress towards their goals and has developed the necessary skills to manage their challenges independently, the counselor might feel that the client has reached a point where formal counseling sessions are no longer necessary.


2. **Client's Request:** Sometimes, clients may express a desire to end counseling sessions. Counselors will discuss this with the client to ensure that the decision is well-considered and that the client feels prepared to manage their well-being without ongoing professional support.


3. **Resource Allocation:** Counselors often work with a limited number of clients due to time constraints. If a counselor has reached their capacity to provide effective care to all clients, they may need to terminate working with some to ensure they can continue to provide the best possible support to others.


4. **Term",ideally termination should be a mutual process it is not that the therapist kicks the client out at some point and says okay you are done rather over time the client will decrease the frequency with which heshe comes to session so that it may start off as weekly then decrease to biweekly then perhaps once every three weeks then oncemonth and so on throughout this process the therapist and client should have had regular check ins about progress toward goals if the client feels good about where heshe is in life heshe might decide to suspend therapy for now that being said the therapist should make it very clear that if the client ever decided to return for maintenance therapy or a check in heshe would always be welcome there is no hard and fast rule to ending or a particular time period in which it must end what matters most is that the client feels good about it and knows that the therapist will always be there should heshe wish to return

after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,"As a mental health assistant, I'd respond:


""After the first meeting with a client, the process a counselor typically facilitates involves several key steps. Initially, the counselor will work to establish a rapport and trust with the client, creating a safe and confidential space for them to share their thoughts and feelings.


The counselor will begin by conducting an initial assessment to understand the client's current mental health, emotional state, and any specific concerns they may have. This assessment helps in identifying the client's needs and setting the direction for therapy.


Together, the counselor and client will collaboratively set goals for therapy. These goals are tailored to the client's individual needs and may focus on improving emotional well-being, coping strategies, communication skills, or resolving specific issues.


The counselor will then introduce the client to various therapeutic techniques and approaches that will be used throughout the sessions. This could include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness practices, or other evidence-based methods.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically decides to end counseling sessions or terminate the working relationship with a client based on a variety of factors.

1. **Client's Progress:** If the client has achieved their therapeutic goals or has made significant progress, the counselor may suggest concluding the sessions.


2. **Client's Request:** Sometimes, clients may feel they have no more to gain from therapy and may request to end the sessions.


3.0 **Sustainability:** If the counselor feels that the client has not made enough progress or that the client might not be able to maintain the gains without ongoing support, they might recommend continuing therapy.

As for whether you should continue or stop, that's a personal decision that only you can make. If it brings you joy and doesn't harm anyone, it's generally okay to continue.

after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,"As a mental health assistant, the process a counselor facilitates after the first meeting with a client typically involves several key steps. Initially, the counselor will focus on building rapport and trust with the client, ensuring a safe and supportive environment. They'll listen attentively to understand the client's concerns, feelings, and experiences.


After establishing a connection, the counselor may begin to explore the client's current situation, including their emotional state, life circumstances, and any specific issues they're facing. This exploration is done through open-ended questions and active listening, allowing the client to express themselves freely.


The counselor will also discuss the goals and expectations of therapy, clarifying the process and setting the stage for progress. They may introduce coping strategies and discuss the importance of self-care and mental well-being.


It's essential to note that while I can provide general guidance, a licensed counselor will tailor their approach to each individual's needs. They will also ensure confidentiality and adhere to professional ethical standards throughout the process.",after meeting a client many counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor if you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us the better we understand what it is that bothers you what you would like to get out of the counseling and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling and that information is too much for this little post

It's not fair for anyone to be penalized for their past actions, especially when it comes to personal growth and healing.

i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago i am worried that at this rate i will not have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i do not want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes,"I hear you, and it sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. It's completely normal to feel anxious about these things, especially when you're at a stage in life where many of your peers are experiencing different milestones. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and there's no rush to do anything you're not comfortable with.

It's great that you're aware of how these thoughts and actions are affecting you. It's important to focus on what feels right for you and your well-being. Have you considered joining clubs or groups at your university that align with your interests? This could be a wonderful way to meet people who share your passions, which might naturally lead to deeper connections.

It's also okay to take things at your own pace. There's no set timeline for when you should have a boyfriend or lose your virginity. These are personal choices that should be made when you feel ready.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to talk to a counselor or therapist who can provide you with support and guidance. They can help you navigate these feelings",i think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries myself included since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single it is similar to fearing that we will not ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we will not be healthy when we have been sick we fear these things because they are so important not because these fears are realistic or true there is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience dating etc while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices experimenting with sex so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal since expectations vary and we cannot be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique virgin or not when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness not a real word but you get what i mean then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships when you are most afraid of being alone remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be normal or whatever that is anyway hope this helps

how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has i have read about this online but i would like to understand this from a therapists point of view,"Therapists often use personality assessments to understand their clients better. One common framework is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on preferences in how they perceive the world and make decisions. Therapists might also look at traits such as emotional stability, openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness, as outlined by the Big Five personality traits model.


From a therapist's perspective, these assessments help to identify patterns in behavior, thought processes, and emotional responses. This understanding can guide the therapeutic approach, tailoring interventions to the client's unique personality and needs. However, it's essential to remember that these are tools for therapists to use, and they are not definitive labels for individuals.

They typically look at various characteristics such as emotional stability, sociability, and coping mechanisms. However, each therapist might have their own approach and criteria.


From a therapist's perspective, they might consider factors like:


- **Emotional Regulation**: How well a person manages their emotions.

- **Social Behavior**: The nature of their interactions with others and their comfort in social settings.

- **Coping Strategies**: The methods a person uses to deal with stress or adversity.

- **Interests and Values**: What a person is passionate about and what they find meaningful.


These characteristics help therapists to create a tailored approach to support their clients, but it's crucial to remember that personality is complex and multifaceted. It's always best to discuss these assessments with a professional who can provide personalized insights.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically decides to terminate counseling sessions based on several factors. Firstly, they assess the progress of the client, ensuring that the goals set at the beginning of the counseling process have been met or sufficiently addressed. It's also important that the client feels equipped to handle future challenges independently.


However, it's crucial to note that the decision to end counseling is a collaborative one, made in partnership with the client. Counselors often discuss the potential for termination during sessions, gradually preparing the client for the transition. This process includes exploring the client's feelings about the end of counseling, discussing strategies for maintaining progress, and planning for any necessary follow-up support.


Remember, the decision to end counseling is unique to each client and their specific circumstances. It's always made with the client's best interest in mind, ensuring their well-being continues to be supported.

we have been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker i do not know how to approach this situation how do i ask him about it,"I can only imagine how challenging this situation must be for you, especially after being in a long-distance relationship for such a significant period. It's completely natural to feel concerned when you see someone you care about interacting with others in a way that makes you uncomfortable.


Firstly, it's important to remember that everyone has relationships with others, and it's not uncommon to have friendly interactions with coworkers. However, it's understandable that you'd want to know more about the nature of these interactions.


Here's a gentle approach you might consider:


1. Reflect on your feelings: Take some time to understand why this situation is causing you distress. Are there underlying feelings of insecurity or jealousy?


2. Choose the right moment: When you feel calm and collected, have a conversation with your partner. Avoid confronting him when you're already upset, as this might lead to defensive reactions.


3. Communicate openly: Express your feelings without making accusations. You might say something like, ""I've noticed you've been texting a lot with a coworker",i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others these questions help couples to build connection and trust it is based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actionsdr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically decides to end counseling sessions or terminate the working relationship with a client based on several factors. It's important to note that this decision is made with the client's best interest in mind and is often a collaborative process between the counselor and the client.


1. **Client's Progress:** The primary consideration is the client's progress towards their therapeutic goals. If the client has achieved or made significant strides in addressing their issues, the counselor may suggest concluding the sessions.


2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor will assess the client's readiness to continue therapy or to end it. This includes evaluating the client's ability to cope independently and their willingness to explore further.


3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** The strength and quality of the therapeutic relationship play a crucial role. If the relationship has been beneficial and the client feels supported, the counselor might recommend continuing the sessions.


4. **Ethical Considerations:** Counselors adhere to ethical guidelines",there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things do not seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor follows through

i have a problem with binge eating especially during times of stress i binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that i end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off i am in my late s and i have been dealing with this since i was a teenager are there any coping mechanisms i can use to break this cycle,"I'm really glad you've reached out to talk about this, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to share such personal challenges. It sounds like you're experiencing a tough cycle with binge eating, especially during stressful times. It's really common for people to turn to food for comfort, but it's also important to find healthy ways to cope with those feelings.


One approach you might consider is mindfulness techniques. These can help you become more aware of your emotions and the triggers that lead to binge eating. Mindfulness can be practiced through meditation, deep breathing exercises, or even just taking a few moments to pause and reflect.


Another strategy could be to find alternative activities that can help you manage stress. Since you've mentioned going to the gym, perhaps you could also explore other forms of physical activity that you enjoy, like yoga, dancing, or hiking. These activities can help you channel your energy positively and might reduce the urge to binge eat.

i am planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking but it is hard sometimes it is not a physical need it is mental i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction,"I can hear that you're going through a tough time, and it's really admirable that you're taking steps to quit smoking for the health of your future baby. It's completely understandable that the cravings are challenging, especially when they're tied to a habit rather than a physical need. Here are a few strategies that might help you manage these cravings:

2. **Seek Support:** Talk to friends, family, or support groups about your struggle. They can offer encouragement and help you stay on track.


3. **Replacement Habits:** Find a healthy habit to replace smoking, such as deep breathing exercises, chewing gum, or a short walk.


4. **Professional Help:** Consider speaking with a counselor or therapist who specializes in addiction. They can provide personalized strategies to overcome your cravings.

Choosing the right therapist is a very personal decision, and it's based on a combination of factors including their approach, expertise, and the connection you feel with them.


To find a therapist that's a good fit for you, consider these steps:


1. **Assess Your Needs**: Reflect on what you're looking for in therapy. Do you need a therapist who specializes in a certain type of therapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy? Are you looking for a therapist with specific qualifications or experience?


2. **Research**: Look for therapists who have experience with the issues you're facing. You can find this information on their websites, through online directories, or by asking for recommendations from your primary care physician or a trusted friend.


3. **Initial Consultation**: Most therapists offer a free or low-cost initial consultation. Use this opportunity to discuss your concerns and",you have the right therapist if you feel safe with that person safety consists of feeling that who you are and what you say is valued the right therapist is not an knowing person you must obey he or she is a person with skilled knowledge who respects you as a partner in your self discovery the right therapist is also one who is kind

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"As a mental health assistant, I can share that counselors typically consider several factors when deciding to end counseling sessions or to terminate their working relationship with a client. It's important to remember that these decisions are made with the client's best interest in mind and are based on professional judgment.


Counselors may decide to terminate counseling for various reasons, including:

1. Achievement of therapeutic goals: When a client has reached their therapeutic goals, the counselor may feel that the client has made sufficient progress and no longer requires regular sessions.
2. Client's readiness: If a client feels they are ready to manage their issues independently, the counselor may suggest ending the sessions.
3. Ethical concerns: If a counselor feels that continuing the sessions would be unethical or harmful to the client, they may decide to terminate the working relationship.
4. Mutual agreement: Sometimes, both the counselor and the client may agree that counseling has served its purpose, and it's time to end the sessions.


However, it's essential to note that counselors",this is a question that is very specific to each person there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyim not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning i strongly encourage you to ask about it
i blame my past relationship for it i know it is bad to be this way i want to get past it,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you've reached out. It's completely normal to feel the weight of past relationships, and it's a sign of strength that you want to move past it. Reflecting on your experiences can be a step towards healing. Have you considered writing down your feelings in a journal or perhaps speaking with a counselor who can help you navigate these emotions? Remember, it's okay to seek support, and taking this step is a positive move forward.

However, it's important to note that this decision is always made with the client's best interest in mind and is a collaborative process between the counselor and the client. If you're considering ending counseling, it might be helpful to discuss your feelings and goals with your counselor to ensure it's the right time for you.""",i will work with clients and continually review progress with them and determine if counseling is helping if a client appears to have less to talk about in sessions appears more stable for a period of time and has reached therapeutic goals i will talk about termination some clients however i may continue with on a monthly or bi monthly process to allow for checkins to see how they are doing and if they need more help at that time

It sounds like you're in a very complex situation with your family and your new relationship. It's important to consider the feelings of everyone involved, especially your children. While it's natural to feel conflicted, it might be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your current wife about your feelings and the situation with the new person in your life.

It's clear you care deeply for your girlfriend and the pain you're experiencing is significant. It's important to allow yourself to feel these emotions, but also to remember that healing takes time. Reaching out to a counselor or therapist could provide you with the support you need to navigate these feelings. They can offer strategies to help you cope and rebuild your emotional well-being.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"As a mental health assistant, I would respond:


""It's great that you're seeking to understand the process better. Counselors typically decide to end counseling sessions or terminate their working relationship with a client based on a few key factors. These include the achievement of the client's goals, the client's progress, and their overall well-being. It's also important that the counselor feels the client has developed the necessary tools and coping strategies to continue their journey independently. However, every situation is unique, and the decision is always made with the client's best interest in mind. Remember, this is a professional process and it's always best to discuss your concerns with a qualified counselor.""",to be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment usually during the initial evaluation i identify my clients short term and long term therapy goals as therapy progress we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis depending on the frequency of the appointments once the therapy goals have been met there is a closing session the counseling relationship is ended and the client can stop attending sessions in some cases the client can also establish new goals and determine if i am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider in which case i provide multiple referralsthe counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process or when the clients or a counselor violates the counseling relationship either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling although as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options as a client no explanation is needed a closing session is highly recommended cmo termina la terapiacmo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejera o terminar de trabajar con un pacientepara poder determinar el final de la relacin del consejero debemos comprender las metas y parmetros de la terapia usualmente durante la evaluacin inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente y se discute con el cliente como esas metas sern alcanzadas durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas hay una sesin de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia en algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero you otro consejero le pueden asistir la relacin de consejera tambin puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parmetros establecidos para la terapia tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relacin de terapia como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razn para la conclusin del tratamiento y proveer referidos segn aplique los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicacin aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesin de cierre
i was with my friends fishing by a pond i found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife i am not sure why i did it my friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me now if someone brings it up i get really upset and panicked i do not know why i feel like this does this mean there is something wrong with me,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. It's completely normal to feel upset and confused after an incident like this, especially when it involves harming an animal and the reactions of your friends. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what's most crucial is learning from them.

It's also completely understandable to feel panicked if the topic comes up. However, it's essential to talk about it with someone you trust, like a family member, friend, or counselor, who can help you process these feelings.

Please remember that",hi winters i am so glad you wrote because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing you feel selfloathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they are supposed to be they feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually but you cannot be both so you cannot ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language this current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words hereyour value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares who you are is so very much more than your sexuality you sound like you have a lot of things going for you try to see all of those things when you think of yourselfthere are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they do not fit in we are all different and you do not have to be anything but who you want to be who you are you do not have to have any kind of sex until you are ready and that makes you brave and smart not weirdyou are tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that it may take time for you to meet the right guy but he is out there the question is how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal i wish you the best
how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically considers several factors when deciding to end counseling sessions or to terminate the working relationship with a client. It's important to note that this decision is made with the client's best interest in mind, and it's not taken lightly. Here are some of the key considerations:

1. **Client's Progress:** The primary focus is on the client's progress and whether they have achieved their therapeutic goals. If the client has made significant strides and feels confident in managing their challenges independently, the counselor may suggest concluding the sessions.

2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor assesses whether the client feels ready to continue without regular sessions. This involves evaluating the client's emotional stability, coping mechanisms, and support systems.

3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** The strength and quality of the therapeutic relationship are crucial. If the counselor believes that the relationship has served its purpose and the client has developed the necessary skills to maintain their well-being, termination may be considered.

4. **Safety",there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated client has met therapy goals client is not progressing therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what is not and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea

It's great to hear that you're focusing on moving forward and cherishing the moments with your wife.

how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,"A counselor typically considers ending counseling sessions or terminating their working relationship with a client based on several factors. These include the achievement of the client's goals, the client's progress, and the mutual agreement on the effectiveness of the sessions. It's essential for the counselor to assess whether the client has developed the skills and strategies needed to manage their issues independently. However, it's also crucial to ensure that the termination of sessions is done in a way that supports the client's continued growth and well-being. If a counselor feels that the client's needs cannot be met within the current framework, they may suggest alternative resources or referrals. Remember, this process is always done with the client's best interest in mind and with their consent.


If you're considering ending counseling, it's important to discuss this with your counselor, who can guide you through the process and help ensure it's a positive step for your mental health.

'I've been taking Xanax twice a day for a month, and while it does help during severe anxiety attacks, I'm finding that it's not as effective for my day-to-day anxiety. I'm concerned about the possibility of dependency, but I'm also struggling with the intensity of my anxiety attacks.

1. **Client's Progress:** If the client has achieved their therapeutic goals, or if the goals have been reassessed and no longer apply, the counselor may suggest concluding the sessions.


2. **Client's Readiness:** The counselor may determine that the client is ready to handle their issues independently, having developed the necessary coping strategies and self-awareness.


3. **Therapeutic Relationship:** A strong, trusting therapeutic relationship is crucial. If the counselor feels that the relationship is no longer beneficial or if there's a conflict of interest, they might suggest termination.

It's clear that you're going through a very challenging time. It's natural to feel conflicted about how much contact to have with your child. Here are some suggestions that might help you navigate this:


1. **Focus on Self-Care**: Taking care of yourself is crucial. Engage in activities that bring you peace and happiness.


2. **Set Boundaries**: Determine what level of contact is comfortable for you and what is best for your child. It's okay to set boundaries that protect both your emotional well-being and your child's.


3. **Professional Guidance**: Consider speaking with a therapist who can provide personalized advice on co-parenting and maintaining a healthy relationship with your child.


4. **Child's Perspective**: It's important to consider your child's feelings, but also remember that they are adapting to their new family situation. They might not fully understand your feelings, and it's okay to have a different relationship with them.


Remember, it's",the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks it is their fault as hard as that already is for a child it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life this makes the belief even more strong for them they start to think why does dad keep leaving what am i doing to keep making him go awayi believe a child needs both parents in their life whether she used you for a child or not that child still exists and never asked for this they did not ask to be born into drama and two parents that cannot make things work you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child if you start over far away this may mean less visits but you will still be a part of their life just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it every child deserves that much good luck to you
