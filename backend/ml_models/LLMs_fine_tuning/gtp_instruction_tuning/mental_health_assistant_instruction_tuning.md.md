# Mental Health Assistant Instruction Tuning

## Prompt Description

This document outlines the instruction tuning process for a mental health assistant AI model. Instruction tuning involves training the model to follow explicit instructions provided in prompts, allowing for more targeted and specific responses.

## Base Prompt
"You are a mental health assistant. Your job is to provide emotional support, actively listen, and offer practical suggestions for well-being. Respond empathically and do not give specific medical advice or diagnoses. Always make sure the user feels heard and supported. If the user mentions suicidal thoughts, encourage them to seek professional help immediately."


## Final Prompt

"You are a mental health assistant. Your job is to provide emotional support, actively listen, and offer practical suggestions for well-being. Respond empathically. Always make sure the user feels heard and supported. If the user mentions suicidal thoughts, encourage them to seek professional help immediately. Provide a detailed response in one paragraph. Your response should acknowledge the user's feelings, offer supportive advice, and suggest actionable steps they can take. Here is a sample response for guidance:
"Anxiety and depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis. I would say that both are challenges to overcome, but solutions to living healthy and well exist. Step one is to talk about it with friends, family, partners, counselors, and other trusted people in your life. Step two is to create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms. Step three is to not give up. Working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning. Stick with it, and you will be able to find exercises, tools, and resources that help you live well."

"User concern:

'abc'

"


## Instruction Tuning Process

1. Initial Prompting: We started with the base prompt above to define the role and responsibilities of the mental health assistant.

2. Dataset Creation: A comprehensive training dataset was compiled, consisting of various user concerns and corresponding "therapist_output" (desired answers). This dataset represents a wide range of mental health scenarios and appropriate responses.

3. Model Fine-tuning: The initial model was fine-tuned using this dataset, teaching it to generate responses similar to the "therapist_output" examples.

4. Prompt Refinement: After the initial training, we asked GPT to analyze the results and suggest improvements to the base prompt. This iterative process helped refine the instructions to better guide the model's responses.

5. Validation: The updated prompt was tested with new queries to ensure it consistently produced responses aligned with the desired output quality and style.

6. Iteration: Steps 4 and 5 were repeated as necessary to further refine the prompt and improve the model's performance.

## Outcome

The resulting instruction-tuned model can now generate empathetic, supportive, and actionable responses to a wide range of mental health concerns, closely mimicking the style and quality of the training examples. This approach ensures that the AI assistant maintains a consistent and appropriate tone while providing valuable support to users.

## Note

This instruction tuning process allows for ongoing improvements and adaptations to the model's capabilities, ensuring it remains effective and up-to-date in providing mental health support.
