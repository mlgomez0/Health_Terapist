question,answer
My wife and mother are having tense disagreements In the past theyve had minor differences For example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy  However its intensified lately I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once Now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements What can I do, What you are describing is something psychologists have termed 34triangulation34 which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead You have been 34triangulated34 by your wife and mother  This is often seen in families Its seen everywhere How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential For example I bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint  Im not saying triangulation is always a bad thing Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree Thats what therapists do every day Sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love  If you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up Even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle   Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife I heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren If your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have From your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to If you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike I am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours   Regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them They will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship Change the dynamics before it spirals even further 
Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental    I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction, Hi Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself Thats a great first step Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addiction  For the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal And if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc Well if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually Ill give in and eat it  Youre going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette Thats normal and for the most part out of your control But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought Thats what you would have to work on changing When you have that initial thought acknowledge it 34Ok I kind of want a cigarette now34 but then change the thoughts that typically follow Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette  Ive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it  Best of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby 
I have secrets in my mind and I dont know what to do with them I dont want to tell my wife and mom because I dont want to hurt them But Im not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself  What should I do Its becoming annoying and making me anxious Help me out, It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now There are several things to consider before you make a decision   You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them    Is it necessary for them to know this information   What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom   Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation   Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves   If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel Would you want to know the secrets   How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health  Once you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not 
I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships How can I fix my underlying issues, Hi there Its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive At the root of it is fear Fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough All those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them The thing is controlling other people only pushes them away Vicious circle right   What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking You can start with this assignment Write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive Then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive For example thinking something like 34Im too pushy34 can be rewritten as 34Im assertive and I go after what I want34 It can be hard to do since we tend to get 34stuck34 in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves If you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself  Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if thats not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there Youve already taken the first step so keep moving forward 
I had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time I have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety Every medicine I have been on my body rejects I get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth How can I calm my self down Im a wreck, You didnt say what or how many medications youve tried Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but I havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects  But beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation Meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting 34Ohm34 to meditate Its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head And when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus Like I said it takes practice so dont give up You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you Like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation  I hope this helps and best of luck to you 
I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it  I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call  I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change How do I stop this behavior and thought process, It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern  You seem to have some good insight into the situation  The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self  This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy  I recommend a book titled Boundaries Where you end and I begin by Anne Katherine  Another book that might be helpful is Codependent No More by Melody Beattie   In the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship  Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own  Needing another person to define you is problematic  Thats too much to expect from any individual  For a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own  That means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs  It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time  There will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs  You have to know how to meet those yourself   When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life  Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you 
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger, I suggest that you work on emotional awareness   Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why  Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do  Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings  Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others  Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood  Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions  For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness  Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger  Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear  Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways  If a man never learns to say I am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood  You can control yourself and not explode  Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out  Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you  What is the real feeling driving these outbursts  Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern   It might help to keep an anger journal  Write down everything that gets you upset  That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off  Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience  
It takes me a long time to fall asleep Id estimate about two hours I often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe  I believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years Also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition I was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning  After improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved However in the past couple months I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning How can I solve this issue, First of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health Thats great that you have added this in your routine Have you also considered altering your diet Certain foods are linked with poor sleep For example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time  On the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep  Additionally at bed time its important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions ie TV IPad Phone Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy  As far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them Certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender   You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing Oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares   Finally Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right away   Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Zs 
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation, I will admit I am confused about this question  Are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist   Therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication  Most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle  They know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court  Of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but I find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation  Not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time  If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this   If you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board  Every therapist is licensed in their state  There are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensure  Most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly  Dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad  Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this  If this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred 
Theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do Im tired of being called names What should I do, It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct Communication is key to any relationship I would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning   Inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly Especially if this friendship is valuable to you However make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them   On the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship Not all friendships are healthy ones And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it  I hope you are able to get this matter sorted Best of luck 
Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family However now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened I feel like I cannot trust him Without trust I cannot stay in this relationship On the other hand I do not want my children to get hurt Im not sure how to move forward, First of all my heart goes out to you Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome There are some things that you should consider First of all did he seem truly remorseful If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake   Secondly was he forthcoming with this information How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation  Thirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience At this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the children  Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome What you are experiencing is 100 normal   My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needs  Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board  Best of luck to you and your family

I have no sex drive due to medical issues Ive shut down completely and closed everyone out Ive even told my husband that I wanted a divorce since thats what I thought he wanted to hear However it devastated me when I learned hes seeing someone else  Ive since told him that I wanted to work things out but hes not sure I actually mean it He thinks the only reason I want him back is because Im jealous  How do I show him Im serious, Im sorry to hear about your current situation My heart goes out to you during this time  First of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing More than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms  Secondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him  If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship   The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof was not your fault  Best of luck to you and your husband 
I have a lot of issues going on right now First of all I have a lot of trouble sleeping at times while other nights I sleep too much and still feel quite tired Im also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours Is there something wrong with me and if so what should I do, Hi there I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be  First off what stressors do you have in your life right now Financial relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all   Secondly do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family Some of the symptoms listed here in this question ie trouble sleeping constant fatigue too much sleep anger amp anxiety are all common symptoms of depression Often times these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for 34just being tired34   Furthermore its important to ask yourself if you are feeling worthless problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death If you are having these symptoms please seek help IMMEDIATELY   Lastly considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult Its always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better  do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits ie how much or little are you sleeping make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks   I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you 
The last of my emotions belong to my pets Today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow If that does happen I might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says here lays my emotions RIP I practically have no emotions left and I came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my familys Whats wrong with me, It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets  I do not know what all is going on in your family and I cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind this  I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills  We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us  If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress  It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc  Develop other things that you care about and are passionate about  Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones  You have to cope somehow right  Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you  I dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe  Both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life  Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse 
Me and my girlfriend just broke up She said she loves me but is not in love anymore This came out of nowhere We seemed so happy together It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed Thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again Then she told me to come to her in Missouri So thats what I did I quit my job I dropped everything said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her Once I got there everything was fine again  She apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week Then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant This wasnt an accident We were trying to get pregnant so all this is hard to accept I love her so much I have never been bad to her Ive treated her the best I can I wanted her to be my wife I was going to propose to her when she got back Now Im losing my family and my mind I dont know what to do, I am sorry to hear of these troubles  I see a few issues here  I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled  Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problems  You say you never treated her badly and I believe you  People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on  In fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy  It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work  There are two books that I recommend you buy and read  One is Codependent No More  The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved  Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind  Sometimes the best thing is to let go  If it is meant to be you will end up back together again  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving  I suggest backing off and letting her go  Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind  If it is meant to be she will come back If not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own 
Now I have anger and trust issues How can I treat this and fix myself, I will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this  However I highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware   There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse  Somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas  That would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issue  The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past  Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you  Angry  Yes At your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you  Having trouble trusting  Of course  The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries Where You End and I Begin 
Ive never been able to talk with my parents My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager I love both of them but not their personalities I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life If my dad doesnt believe me then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either Im a pansexual but I cant trust my own parents  Ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me I feel that my friends dont listen to me I know they have their own problems which I do my best to help with But they dont always try to help me with mine when I really need them I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust, Hi there Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents werent listening to me Its even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in   Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through In addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety We all have stress and anxiety in our lives If we didnt none of us would be living Anxiety amp stress keep us on our toes Often I have to remind myself of this as well However it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives   Are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety   Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in  Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity I know that sounds silly But its true You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold Imagine being in the Doctors office and taking deep breaths This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards   Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety You will need a quiet place for your meditation You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity All it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place Some people use meditation music as well If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it   Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice I would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students   Lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end If they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue   I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best  
I have been with this guy on and off for 8 years At first we used to do things together and our sex life was ok Then things started to change wed break up and reconnect and he cheated on me numerous times  Weve also had two beautiful baby girls during this time Now we argue and he says I am not affectionate at all or I dont know how to please a man when I work parttime take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook Sometimes he cooks but he also spends a lot of time on the internet In addition I have 2 boys and he has 1 son I feel somewhere I have lost something Its not that I dont care I truly love this guy but Im just tired of being the one who is always being judged Please I am in need of a Christian counselor to help us because I really need to speak to someone, I dont think youve lost something I think youve found something  your breaking point and its about time Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him Obviously he has his own issues but I want to address yours I agree you need to talk to someone The fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better You do You may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  And although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way Would you want your sons to treat women this way Thats what youre teaching your children when they see this  Like I said I agree that you should talk to someone You can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont Even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on YOU I understand its not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth 
My son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams Not violent like hes hurting someone but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones He explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening It was far beyond anything in a horror movie he says he cant help these thoughts they just pop up Please help, Let me start my stating this is important to take seriously  taking to his PCP getting a referral to a pediatric specialist and getting him to a relational psychotherapist would be my first tasks   I wont label this occurrences as 34normal34 yet it is important to note these things do occur My first observation is to say that it is a tremendous advantage that your son is communicating what he is experiencing Id encourage him to continue to do so no matter the extent of his thoughts  his trust of you being able the handle his experience is of utmost importance His containment and sense of security is also dependent on your reaction to what he shares Seek professional help communicating your support including a plan of action and reassuring him you will figure this out together will help you as you begin

I need to get on base to see my doctor My ID card was in my wallet which was stolen Im unable to reach my husband at this time He is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new ID so I can continue to see doctor Is there anything I can do, Do you have any other form of identification The first place to stop would be the Visitors Center or whichever department issues passes They are located outside of the gate so you do not need a military ID to enter If you have another form of identification its possible that they can give you a pass in order to go and obtain a new military ID   If you do not you could always ask someone else to sponsor you on a friend coworker etc that have military access Depending on the threat level they may not need your ID as long as you are with someone that has access Keep in mind that currently 61115 all military bases are on Bravo which unfortunately means you will need your own ID  Finally if all else fails call your doctor and explain your situation Im sure they would be more than willing to discuss your options  Also its important to make sure that you report your wallet being stolen if you havent already Security Forces on base can help you with this and to ensure your ID doesnt get into the wrong hands   Good luck 
Ive known my boyfriend for several years We were friends for a long time In 2013 we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job However during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time We decided later to make it work Shortly after I found out that I was pregnant I wanted to tell him during his next visit However he never came to see me and instead asked me for money After I gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts     Soon after I experienced a miscarriage I texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care I was extremely hurt by this I still decided to move back as I had originally planned He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him During this time I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know Although he says he did I hardly ever see him He never got a job which was in the original plan      After that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together Once we got back together I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in I thought he had too But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman In fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her When I confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car I dont know what to do,olol There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented with olliSeveral breakups lilispanNot holding up his end of the bargain regarding workspanlilispanLack of empathy for your miscarriagespanlilispanLying about his involvement with another womanspanlilispanPhysical violence which is of most concern spanliol This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship In my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself Is this really someone I want to marry Is he an asset to my life I think youll realize he is not  Best of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect 
I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant Im coping as best as I can Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesnt care as well as most other people in my life I feel like I dont exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on I am losing faith in humanity itself, I am very sorry to hear of your struggles  I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years so try not to be too hard on yourself  Take it one day at a time and do the best you can  I notice that you said he left you  This tells me that you didnt have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you  Low selfesteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they cant do any better  Also abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get  The way I see it he did you a favor   You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be   Take this time alone to work on you  As hurtful as it may be that other people dont want to help you this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you  Your statement I dont feel like I exist anymore tells me that in addition to low selfesteem you also dont have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are  People can and will let you down  It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment learn to take care of your own needs and to gain a stronger sense of self   Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it  Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath do something that makes you feel good  Find a hobby that you enjoy  Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily  Google positive affirmations to find some that resonate with you  Such statements might be I am a good person who deserves to be happy or I can do this  Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well  There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search  Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing  When you are a happier more stable person the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them  Good luck with rebuilding your life  I know it is hard  Remember to take it one day at a time 
Ive been married for 3 years and I have two kids During my 3years married my husband cheated on me twice  The second time really got to me and at my lowest I hurt him back We arent communicating as well as I would like What do I do, Hi there Thank you reaching out for help It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can   First and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man Im going to assume there are So the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going If he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily I cannot stress this enough Although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation So you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time Its always better to be safe than sorry   Secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children  Its unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself  
I have been with my husband for almost 7 years We got engaged a little after 5 years of being together I had always been clear that I wanted to get married and I sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose  When he did propose it was during a random vacation that I had planned I was happy but I couldnt help feeling disappointed too I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldnt help how I was feeling We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds  I know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but I cant help but get jealous and envious every time I see someone get a proposal or wedding that I had wanted I cant help my anger because I know we only get one proposal and one wedding What I wanted will never happen I have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it I try to focus on our marriage but every time I see someone have the best proposals and weddings I get upset I know it is selfish and I know its petty but I just cant control it Its ruining our relationship because I constantly think about it Plus I get mad at him for small things because I am trying to hide the fact that I am so disappointed  Why cant I move on, Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement This was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either   However like you know the marriage is the most important thing  How many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship I assure you that there are plenty   Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired Focus on what you can control NOW Perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring  I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately But after that close that chapter and move on It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change 
What can I do to stop grieving my mothers death  When I am awake I just cry every day I dont have anyone to talk to I need help I am still cry over her  Will I ever stop crying Its been 3 years, I am sorry that you lost your mother That is a really hard thing for someone to go through  There is really no set time for grief to be over but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief  I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help  For one thing bills have to be paid  There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order  You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced Denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages   At first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone  This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died  Then comes bargaining in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever   Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss  It sounds like you are stuck in this phase  Finally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on  When we lose someone we never forget them  We may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one  But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes on  A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it  One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings dont try to not feel them  Embrace the feelings  Let the feelings wash over you and accept them  Trying not to feel something is not going to help  Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does  Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided  I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now  You deserve to be happy and to live a full life  I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long  I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief 
Im having issues with my relative The police never believe the experiences I have been through because I am only a kid     Ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because I said I wanted to get an adult to help me Could you please give me advice, I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children Its called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline The number is 18004ACHILD 18004224453   It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you want  The call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day  7 days a week   Im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation You are a very brave and an intelligent child   Please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger 
My wife just last week said she wants a divorce and its all sudden I understand that marriages have their ups and downs but I dont understand why she cant tell me why she wants a divorce Should I fight for my family daughter and wife, Chances are if you really think about it there were signs that something wasnt quite right in your marriage You may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage but whatever it was or wasnt its obviously bothering your wife I would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable Ask your wife if shes willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor Just be sure youre open to hearing whats said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some things  Even if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce that doesnt mean youre divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that Continue to be a part of her life And although it may be difficult if a divorce does happen try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isnt further impacted by this new family dynamic 
I loved him more than anything He passed away on our anniversary which was also the day I was going to apply for our apartment Im not handling it well I moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps, I am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing Grief is something that can take a long time to recover from Have you considered speaking with a grief counselor Being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial   Do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward   In the mean time immerse yourself with positivity ie Good friends hobbies exercise and try to schedule a time with a counselor   Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join Oftentimes it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as you  Good luck to you I hope you will find peace and comfort soon 
I did some horrible sexual things as a kid and I regret everything Can someone help me cope with myself Can someone help me remember my past, Im very sorry to hear this Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories However keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone   I think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward   In addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise   I wish you the best of luck and I hope you receive the treatment that you deserve 
I have been with a guy for 4 years  hes a great guy and we also have a son together The problem is that Im in love with a guy that Ive been talking to for about 2 years but Ive never met him in person Honestly Im bored with the relationship I have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy I dont know how to tell him that What should I do, Hi there Wow this sounds like a sticky situation however Im here to help guide you through this decision   First and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child Its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do Right Well not entirely  Although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run If you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating  When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions amp behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such As a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child Just remember what you do your child will model   Secondly do not sell yourself short from love Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with However being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky Honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love  Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need  If you decide to pursue the second relationship I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days   Finally I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys  This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not You should ask yourself if you were in love with your childs father first off If you were you would have never sought after love  I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation Take care of yourself 
My boyfriend cant get over my promiscuous past He says he loves me  but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction He says he should have had more sex with different people I dont know how to handle this, I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles   One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about  In the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this  I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history  For one thing it is a good idea to be checked for STDs before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other  Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do  This gets into a gray area for some people  I dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly dont want a whole lot of details  Sometimes that is an image I just dont want in my head about my partner  Vague details are usually enough  However I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past  This is a reflection on him not you  This shows insecurities on his part  You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information  The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future   If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship  You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you  I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity  It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though   If your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go  Dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you  Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment I dont see that you have done anything wrong  If you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him  Ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go Dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you  It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be  In time the right person for you will enter your life 
What do I do if I have been feeling like I could never be with anyone because no one would want me Or I couldnt have many friends because of who I am Its strange I want to be loved but Id hate to be because I always lose, Im sorry you are feeling uncared for Im sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration Sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing However take a deep breath relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem I think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about you  I also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with Maybe you can attend a religious service join an interest group ie reading club sports group etc or start a group of your own Most importantly you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health From this relationships will start to immerse   You may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved This is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and I think with a little help you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship   Thanks for reaching out and I wish you the best of luck moving forward   
What makes my step child an 8 year old boy choke my daughter a 6 year old girl This has been going on for 4 years The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him He knows its wrong we have did time out spanking taking away toys and sitting on the wall I am afraid for my daughters safety, I can see why you are alarmed That is a scary situation for a parent Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional Early treatment is often the key A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses   Have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence sexualphysical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced   spanI wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy Until then I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults carespan 
I have this weird fetish that Im afraid to open up about it What should I do, This is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though   The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not  If this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges  However if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of  You may find other people have the same interest as you  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them  Dont hold back with your therapist  Trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are  There is no need to suffer with this alone  
My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying I have mood swings They have no proof to back it up Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice, I cant give you legal advice but employers can suggest you see someone if your behavior is affecting your job I believe most government agencies have an Employee Assistance Program EAP where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue not just workrelated for free up to a certain amount of sessions  Im wondering though why your coworkers would tell your boss this if its not true Is it possible that youre not aware of how your interactions are affecting others Maybe this forced counseling can be an opportunity for some introspection on your part 
Im in a state of depression right now Who can I talk to Ive been sick in a lot of pain and crying Dont know where to turn, First of all if youre sick and in pain have you seen your doctor If you have a chronic illness and pain this can often lead to depression and is very common Youve taken the first step to dealing with it You can talk to your doctor even if your depression isnt related to your health He or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist  spanIf thats not really an option for you there are also helplines local or national or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other If you cant find any in your area newspapers usually publish this information there are online support groups as well spanbr 
My dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties dinners etc Whenever I have an opinion it gets shut down My mom and everyone else behaves likewise For my father who heads a company this is normal He has to be right all the time He blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle     Recently however its been getting to the point where I feel pressured and unable to speak my mind It isnt possible for me to get professional oneonone help He tells me to grow a pair and get over it I recently have been developing more severe body image and selfconfidence issues which I have had all my life I feel invalidated by my dad  I have been more paranoid lately as well I cant turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident He makes me feel guilty about it  I feel rather worthless more often than not unfortunately  What do I do, Im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment I would recommend talking with another adult such as a  school counselor that can offer you support in this area Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with them  If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enough  Good luck 
Im a 40 year old male and having erection problems Still have the desire for a woman Awfully frustrated Any suggestions My Doc doesnt want to discuss it, Hi there first off I have to commend you for reaching out It takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems Believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women   There are some things that you can try naturally before resulting in medication such as your eating habits and exercise I would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day Do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly How much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily  These are just a few common things to look at You would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies Our bodies are like a car You have to maintenance it in order for it to continue to run   spanIf you would like to get further natural advice andor suggestions on eating healthy and exercising I would recommend you see a nutritionist A nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet As far as your Doctor I would recommend looking into getting another Doctor I have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything That appears to be a personal issue on their part I hope I was helpful and I wish you the best of luckspan 
My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad It was a time when my health was poor Im have a hard time moving on, How has your husband acted since then Was he regretful How did you find out Did he confess These are all things that you want to consider Betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over know that this is normal  Hopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this   Its also very important to discuss WHY he cheated You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future And if it can there needs to be an action plan in place ie being honest with how hes feeling so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation  If the cheating has happened more than once you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldnt repeat the same mistake However if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake I would give it a try People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have  Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel If the relationship was a good healthy relationship it is worth saving Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings In return your husband should be patient and understanding of this   Also marriage counselors are often a good goto as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations   Best of luck to you 
Ive been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason I keep getting with men that I let emotionally abused me  How can I stop it I know the mistakes that Ive made in my life Im having a really hard time getting back on my feet Can you help me please, I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  Until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solution  Dont misunderstand me  The abuse is not your fault You are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed   First go and buy the book Boundaries Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine  Read it  This book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them  Be single for a while  Stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  Often we get in a relationship because of a need  If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own  I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  This was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  However she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  When she looked at him in our session and said to him I dont need you I want you  But not if you are going to continue to act like this  So you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes  She stuck to that too  He didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left She was fully prepared to be single again  They actually did end up working things out in the end  You cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  Sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  Someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone  If they feel they need the other person in their life   These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  You cant change your partner  Work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become 
I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls I think Im like a girl stuck in a guy body I imagine myself as a girl too I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one And I dont care about having boobs or anything I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl, I understand that gender andor sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate although in todays time I think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from society  I am unsure how old you are  If you are a child or teenager this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life  I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do  A lot of people unfortunately do not and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you  Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions  I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time  By this I mean a sex change  Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly  Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis  Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes  Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice  Maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could do  See if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area PFLAG stands for Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays  They are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay but also transgendered and asexual   I wish you all the best in your identity crisis  It would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time  Find a professional that can help especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself 
Ive have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation, The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors  This is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety  This takes a therapist trained in CBT   There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept  A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over  This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped  In cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in  One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression  Other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back  They do this with having positive coping skills in their life  Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with  A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change  There are things that you can do  Here is a quote for you to consider  You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made  You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes  Another quote I like is You will find a way or you will find an excuse  Dont ever say that you have no choice  Everyone has a choice  You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices  Not happy in a relationship  You can leave it  Hate your job  Get a new one  If it matters to you you will find a way  Dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better  Take care of yourself  Exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well  Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself  Also find a meditation that works for you  There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more  Start making some positive changes in your life today  You can do it 
Hello I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city I know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed     I have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship     What can I do, Do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does If they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting Then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of love  Even if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love The fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you  
I have a child with my baby mother She works I take care of our young son She says she is not cheating I have not found anything but she always putting me down telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me but then the next day after our fight she says she does Im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops Now me and my family dont talk Shes always telling me Im annoying and just belittles me Nothing I do is right  She says I work you watch the baby On her days off she never cooks or cleans I have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy but says hes not any thing to her What do I do I dont want to leave, It sounds like you are in a tough situation You have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her Is it because of the child Or is it because you want the relationship to work You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child So if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move out  On the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship Although your question revealed just a short bit of information I didnt read about any positives in the relationship   Sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you However with time and focus you can do it Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your child  However if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you This gives her a chance to render the situation If after this there is no improvement I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stay  I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy Are there any hobbies you enjoy Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit  It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately  Thank you for reaching out I wish you the best of luck with your relationship 
Or how to send him somewhere that can help him something like The Baker Act, More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question such as your age whether you live with your dad or not and what other family members live in the household   Something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease  In other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior  First of all you cant make your dad do anything and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse  Nobody can change another person  What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him   Research codependency  Theres a great book called Codependent No More  There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read  In short you have to stop enabling him  Like I said you cannot control him but you can control yourself  This means do not buy his alcohol  Do not make it easy for him to get  Dont loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him  Dont call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way  Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested He needs to be responsible for himself This may mean losing his job or losing his drivers license This may mean that he loses his family if he doesnt stop   What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with  It is his choice to drink but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking  A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they dont then they are getting a divorce  If you are an adult and you dont live with your dad then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him  If you are a child who lives at home with him then this could be a case for child protective services In my state this is called DHS  A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect  Substance abuse in the home qualifies  Of course alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation there is no problems  The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption  Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated  Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state  Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking  This could be a reason for the authorities to step inspan span  You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics  They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to but are for the family members  They can help you  
In particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs, I think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes Although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction   There are many families that are united despite their differences For example a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish By introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial   Also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences So dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues   Creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential  
I dont know whats wrong with me At times I can be really happy excited Ill talk fast and I want to do things But lately Ive been staying up way later and sleeping too much I dont hang out with friends I dont really have them I feel nothing worthless I want to do nothing I have no interest in anything     All I usually do is stay in my room I want to be happy I want to be nice Whats wrong with me, Im sorry to hear that you are feeling as if youre in a slump First of all nothing is wrong with you Many people report similar symptoms Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them  Its possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help   Thanks for reaching out I hope that you will feel back on track soon 
Im worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status Im just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone, Thanks for your question Im glad you realize that you need extra support and are being proactive Simply explain to your doctor the feelings you have been experiencing and how you feel that speaking with a mental health therapist would be beneficial However  keep in mind that you do not have to go into detail about your personal feelings You can simply state that you are feeling down overwhelmed stressed or whatever it may be   Im sure your doctor will be glad to direct you from there   Best of luck you you I hope that you will be feeling better soon  
I feel like my time is going too fast, Thank you for reaching out That is a great question As an American I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe I often ask myself what if I only had one day left on this Earth What would I do Well that is an easy question I would spend it with my family Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World right Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring  Time management is a very important factor when learning to 34live life to the fullest34 In fact this is a required course in undergraduate college now Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this Personally for myself I like to keep a calendar with a todo list I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list That way if I do not get through the list I am not stressing over the little things When planning your day it is important you schedule work eat and play A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work it must be done There is discipline involved in this process If you have trouble with this then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spousepartner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work  These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there Again everyone has their own style on time management I hope this was helpful for you Please dont hesitate to reach out for anything further 
Im worried I should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status Im just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone, Having this kind of conversation with a doctor can feel difficult  But remember you are the expert on you  Any good medical professional will recognize that  You are absolutely right to think about the importance of being your own health care advocate  Generally the best approach is simply to be honest  Let your doctor know what you are concerned about and tell your doctor what you think might help  If there is a specific issue that youd like to address in counseling let you doctor know about it  And dont hesitate to directly ask for a referral  I know this may all feel a little overwhelming  It might help to bring a family member or significantother with you to provide support when you talk to your doctor  Its great that youve already taken this first step to reach out  Youre on the right track 
My last relationships have ended horribly They just up and abandoned me One of them I have never gotten closure with over it leaving me emotionally wrecked I know somethings wrong with me but I dont know how to even start trying to better myself  I get into these depressed like states whenever anyone I care about is too busy to be with me I know that I shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy but I feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me, Frequently when working with clients I utilize the ABC model developed by Albert Ellis the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event For instance here is an example ullibA Action or Eventb You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backlilibB Behavior or Responseb You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this personlilibC Consequenceb You feel depressedliul If you look at the model B has a direct effect on C The thought is if you change your reaction to A then C will have a better consequence such as ullibAb stays the samelilibB this is what you changeb This person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availablelilibCb Decreased feelings of depression amp overall functioning improvesliul This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve If this model resonates with you I recommend 34Feeling better getting better staying better34 by Alber Ellis In addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone 
I havent uttered one word to my boyfriend in days Now Im over it and dont know how to approach the situation, In any relationship it is important to be able to say 34Im sorry34 because it shows vulnerability and openness I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future If you find yourself becoming upset again I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hearunderstand what your partner is trying to convey 
Ive been with my boyfriend over 3 years He cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant He is physically and mentally abusive towards me I have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues however he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything Im always there when he needs my help He tells me although I help him doesnt mean that I am a good person He always discredits me as a woman and its hurtful I spend most day crying and feeling lonely I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do, That sounds like a very hurtful situation Unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship As an abuser his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing transportation and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship There is help out there and you are not alone If you need any additional resources in your area please dont hesitate to contact me  
I started dating a guy I met online He told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years That was more than two decades ago Nothing on his record since I always believe the past should be left in past But my roommates their family and my son are unforgiving Should I forgive this man that Im falling in love with or should I dump him If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again, Thank you for your question Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair From what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since Unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive If you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom We cannot control others but only ourselves Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship Good luck to you 
About 3 years ago or so I was skinny but I was still ugly I really do want to change that but Ive tried 3 times Now can I try but dont stop At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them How can I stop thinking about them and dont let it get in my head My parents said I dont weight that much but they do think I am fat but they tell me I am not I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist but they think I am fine and I think they dont want to deal with it, Hey  I am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself and to get support  And it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life  Take a walk over to the counseling office at school the school nurse or consider reaching out to your Pediatricians office You dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself  And maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health  I am rooting for you  Be Wise 
A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy She told me I was attractive and have a great personality etc I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning Now though I cant stop thinking about her but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldnt matter I feel helpless and I dont know what to do, Hey  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings  A big part of the process however of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness  Try this  Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list  Then carry it with you in your wallet  and when you need a selfesteem boost take a look at it  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities  Reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support  and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer  Be Wise 
She cried because she lost all trust in me Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do I do, Hey  Sounds like the part of you that knows the RIGHT thing to do won here  I am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your Mom  Sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear  I bet that as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more she will begin to gain trust in you again  Be open with your feelings with you Mom  she is there to support you guide you and love you  Give her lots of hugs  and give yourself one too for being so brave  Be Wise 
When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long Been married 3 years together 14 What do you think, Sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff Its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage 34should34 be It sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing Intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow Resparking your passion will involve growing Using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires Marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required  
We make love once per month Is it normal, To begin with whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind Your sexual lives will ebb and flow What Id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having Id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection I wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it a hrefhttpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments targetherea  
In this argument my friends are all against me so Im wondering if Im exaggerating my feelings I feel like Im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim when in reality Im the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship, Conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in beveryb one of our relationships What Im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of  seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself Am I right If you arent validating yourself no one else will be able to either  Try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing  And then if you are still feeling vulnerable share that too

We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says How can I fix things, Being able to accept your partners influence is a key relationship skill And its very two sided  Chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either The best ifix iyou can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence  Play with it  
My wife and I are newly married about 2 months Weve had some issues surrounding sex particularly her lack of libido Shes on an anxiety medication of which diminished libido is a side effect but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule Our sex life has suffered as a result Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex which is a big deal Once things started she had the most obviously fake orgasm Ive ever encountered I was honest with her about why and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking I dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further Please help, You are newly married you Have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication What if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another You know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection I wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments And have fun with it  
Im always told Im not good enough or trying hard enough I put 100 in to every thing Im worn out Ive worked on all of my family relationships Im doing great in school Im kind to those in need and otherwise I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I dont have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from   Somehow its still not good enough and nothing I do works Nothing has changed and I feel hopeless Any suggestions or ideas, Hello and let me say first what a great question   There are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve Without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question  First I think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre 34not good enough34 Is that ACTUALLY what they said or is this just what you heard Sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others Again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern If so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being 34good enough34 Explore with them how you feel your already giving your best  If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship Some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic It may be they have their own 34stuff34 going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better If youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life If its a relationship that MUST continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems Until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation   Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals NO ONE will ever be 100 34good enough34 for EVERYONE Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives   The question becomes what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations There is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels 34less than34 and feels as if you yourself are not good enough It then becomes impossible to every feel 34good enough34 for others because its really YOU youre trying to feel good enough for If you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on LETTING GO of the rest No one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left After all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow  I recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra 34No one can make you feel inferior without your consent 34  Eleanor Roosevelt  
Im always told Im not good enough or trying hard enough I put 100 in to every thing Im worn out Ive worked on all of my family relationships Im doing great in school Im kind to those in need and otherwise I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I dont have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from   Somehow its still not good enough and nothing I do works Nothing has changed and I feel hopeless Any suggestions or ideas, The feeling of never feeling good enough usually stems from our early relationship with our parents or significant role models who made us to feel we were never good enough to meet their standards In the healing process youll need to work on discovering the root source of where these thoughts and feelings come from and then learn to accept yourself just as you are unconditionally Id be pleased to help you in this process I provide online private counseling through proventherapycom   Dr Rachelle Vaughanbr 
Hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why I love him very very much He sometimes thinks Im obsessed when Im not at all I give him his space and I make sure hes okay but  sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better I truly want me and him to get better its kind of hard not to stress about it because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling Hes a great guy I just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me Hes starting to put less effort in talking to me At this point Ill do anything to just make us better as a couple I tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much Advice on what to do, Im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear but Id suggest giving him space Ooph thats a tough one right I know But heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away He needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship Its the work of being in relationship to learn this I get that this is tough stuff I wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself Thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now 
I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it  I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call  I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change How do I stop this behavior and thought process, You may be interested in reading my most recent post a hrefhttpconnectfulnesscomintimacybeginswithyou targetIntimacy Begins With Youa In it I offer 7 expert tips to help you get started on a path of self connection and discovery This is important stuff to do in order to work through that stuff thats holding you back from the relationships you desire You may find that its especially helpful to do this work with the alliance of a skilled individual therapist

I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs, Hey dogs are cool They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them Your girlfriend on the other hand likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours You are good with dogs that tells me that youve spent some time observing their behavior The first step in working through this issue would be similar start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships  
I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about How do I figure out what triggers me to do this And how do I help overcome this problem I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation, Well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had you want to notice that you have triggers Thats huge Really   I find that when people lie its most often as a defense mechanism Which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe What exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you   It could really help to explore this with therapist perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty  thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers  
Ive been like this ever since I was in school back then I transferred to another school Now Im thinking about changing my job, I recommend that you make a list of all the reasons you should change your life and all of the reasons you shouldnt change your life Can the problem you are in be fixed Is there others you can lean on for support Are there other people you know who have been through a similar experience and are willing to share their story with you It is important to rely on your support network to help you get multiple points of view If you believe you need additional help I suggest seeing a professional 
I keep hearing I am attractive from people around me and I think I believe it But I have low confidence regarding approaching girls I like, I recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach a girl When you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs you can then work on changing them An easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words 34must or never34 Once you recognize the thought or belief I would like you to picture a big red stop sign This is called thought stopping This is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts Then I would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as Negative thought 34That girl will never go out with me34 STOP Positive thought 34I wont know if she will go out with me unless I ask34 What this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem 
We have been fighting a lot and have 3 kids but we both want to stay together I need some help to save our family, Hello I do not live in the California area However perhaps I could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling First I must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues including family issues If your girlfriend lives with you most insurances now cover 34livein partners34 as well If you have insurance contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is included  Aside from insurance the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation Do you belong to a church or other religious organization Many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling These services are ordinarily offered free of charge to members  Another option might be to explore support groups within the area There may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group If you find there are no such groups in your area there are anonymous support groups online Here is one such site httprelationshipsupportgroupscom

We kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls It went on for about 8 months Just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room Once I met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop We ended up kissing after lunch and then I sent him a few more texts that day telling him I was serious and that was the end of it His wife my good friend saw us kiss once and told my husband I told him a couple of things then and we got over it A year later she told him a couple of other things Same story Its been about 3 years since They are now divorced and my husband and I have been happy A few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did I decided to just tell my husband everything We are trying to work things out But he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it How can I help him believe me, The issue at hand here is that youre betrayal broke his trust In order to repair your relationship you will both need to span stylecolor rgba26 26 26 0701961float nonebackgroundcolor rgb255 255 255confront the infidelity And both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated It would be really helpful to do this work with a Gottman or Emotionally Focused Couples Therapist Gottmans The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along span

I feel that I need to end my present relationship He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month  I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion Lately he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks I told him that I cant continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want We have been together 7 years The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like We have gone through this cycle already 45 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile, Sounds like your panic is less about loosing the relationship you are in which by the way doesnt sound like its meeting YOUR need for connection and more about being alone Being with him is serving you even if the relationship is less than ideal from being alone Being alone can be scary Youd have to face yourself Youd have to learn to love and care for and cherish yourself All important skills and tasks in maturing and growing up but scary none the less What ifWhat if you gave yourself permission to be in a relationship with YOU

Im in a relationship but I feel like Im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated My ex told me that I will never find anyone else and thats lingering in the back of my mind, The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter  Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter Thats why it didnt work with him btw He wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered However it ended clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you  So here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message Move on You arent unworthy you just havent found a man who is worthy of you   To be worthy of you he must see your worth Often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it   
This is preventing me from getting a job I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room I have no friends or other family to help me I have no money for therapy but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job, A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider amp discuss your concerns  They would have resources available to help in your particular situation 
I have no self control over food Most people stop when theyve had enough but I keep eating for the pleasure of it Especially with sweets  Im never done eating dessert, Hello Im so glad you decided to write in today This is such a great question and Im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern   First I think its important to understand food is just food Food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations But in many cultures we place a LOT of emphasis on food We have food at every gathering and every celebration Whats more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every gettogether And if its not Well then forget about it   I see this time and time again with my clients Donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before iMust eat one or twoi However we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food It is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day During these moments I like to have my clients employ a StopandThink method StopandThink about your goals before you eat Is this donut getting you where you want to be Also I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut If the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut But if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that 34special34 donut   Another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating Are you trying to drown out other emotions Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment What ELSE is going on This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers By targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record  The most important thing to remember is that 34food addiction34 can be a real problem for a lot of people If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands   There are lots of free resources and information on my website at wwwmaddenwellnesskycom In addition I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and I would love to help   Amber 
I have no self control over food Most people stop when theyve had enough but I keep eating for the pleasure of it Especially with sweets  Im never done eating dessert, I would recommend removing yourself from the environment you are in after you have finished eating A simple walk around the block calling up a friend and going to visit or even going to another room in the house can help If you find that you truly have no self control over food I recommend attending Overeaters Anonymous a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related to food I hope this helps  
I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him Once he believes I am being negative I cant seem to find a better way of communicating In fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating     What advice might you offer, With any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc    Begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode  br  Then share how you felt at the time of the event  Just say when I felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  PERIOD  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY  Wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statement  No matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  You can even add 34I agree I could have misunderstood  it event I just know it made me feel uneasy34  Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate  Good luck amp Id love to hear how it goes

He is in his late thirties and I am in my mid twenties We have been together for about 5 months I really like him He says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right He has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear I dont know if its worth giving him a second chance, Cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship His fear may be full of information While its possible to repair relationships after a betrayal its also challenging to do especially so early in your relationship I cant tell you if you shouldshouldnt give this relationship a second chance but I will tell you to tune into your own intuition and follow your own fears in doing so they often are incredibly informative when we dont push them away with denial

I have recently separated from my husband whom I have been with for 5 years  Throughout our 5 years together I have stood by him through 2 affairs him talking to other women while I was pregnant his drug abuse and thru verbal and physical abuse, It usually boils down to a lack of self esteem self love and self acceptance If for whatever reason the scripts we have been told about ourselves from others or what we have witnessed as children has become our beliefs about what to expect from life and others have been negative it is hard to imagine a different reality for ourselves  If what we have learned and observed in our close environment has not taught us and inspired a healthy self esteem then we can not know what it is and how it feels like It is as if we lack the language the words to define it and the skills to practice it  Putting up with a loved ones drug addiction their infidelity lack of respect and esteem verbal and physical abuse tend to show and reflect the degree of our lack of self esteem lack of sense of self worth lack of belief that we are worth and deserve more from life  Separating was the first step towards reversing this negative situation Spending time on your own and distancing yourself from your past experiences with him will give you a better and clearer perspective The fact that you are asking yourself this question shows that at some level you are aware that something is not quite right It is just a matter of finding out exactly what it is how you got where you are now and how to get where you want to get in your life in the future  Working with a therapistcounselor will help you understand the mechanisms and learn how to build a healthy sense of self esteem Get a good sense of who you are and what you want And finally design the right strategy and plan of action to achieve your goal to move on in a healthy manner  You have made the first step it is now a matter of being consistent in seeking help and doing the work until you achieve what you want Become who you want to be and create the life you want for yourself  br  br

About 5 months ago my ex left without fully explaining why For me it seemed out of the blue I dont miss her as much as I used to but I just dont trust people anymore not even my friends who I have known since my childhood not even my family Im so terrified of being judged or dismissed Instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality Ive just shut down I havent felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart Im scared to because I dont want it to be taken away from me again I feel like ever lesson I learn only last a day I just dont know what to do Im working at a place I know I should enjoy Im keeping up with my creative passions working out eating healthy etc Im doing everything the books say I should do but I dont feel any different I just dont know what to do, Sounds like you need closure Im sure your doing your best to overcome this feeling but seem to be struggling with your own happiness Trust God no one else Give this some time and dont close yourself off to the world or the people who love you Be open hearted and minded And know that no matter what reason your ex walked out of your life she missed out on how great of a person you truly are and may have had personal issues of her ownnbsp 
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me This rollercoaster is crazy, Your partners obviously very confused when it comes to love Sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid They know that its something worth holding on to but most feel they cant handle it and cant meet up to their partners expectations Your partner loves you but must have fear that keeps standing in his way It could also mean their afraid of getting hurt or disapointed in the long run nbspGive your partner comfort and reassurance that they can come to you to confide in you about anything that may be bothering themnbsp

She was raised by her abusive father and his wife 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years When I was released she was 5 and didnt remember me Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana She doesnt remember that I do Over the years I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption Last night I was angry at the world and afraid of God I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running Now Im not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now Help, Was either parent abusive or violent toward you  You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life  br  One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships  A lot of what youve lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetrator  If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do so  At the very least youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation

Why am I attracted to older men, What a wonderful question  Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities  If I was sitting with you now Id ask you to list your reasons  Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further  br  If for example you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self even when this sets you apart from your friends  If you feel you need a man to protect you financially then possibly youve lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself  If youd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately then youve found the best reason for wanting a man in your life  This is far different than need  br 
I found out my boyfriend takes antidepression medicine Lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind and he needs time to think about us Weve only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot, Your boyfriend may like you a lot as well  People have different styles of reflecting on their lives one of which is to retreat the way you describe your boyfriend doing  One point you can consider is asking for a time frame of when hed be ready to discuss his thoughts on your relationship  Hes entitled to retreat as much as youre entitled to talk  Cooperating with the other persons way of handling themselves is one aspect of relating  Since the antidepressants are a concern for you consider bringing up this topic when the two of you do talk 
I have been with my best friend for over a year and we have had a beautiful baby girl We were in love and I still love her dearly I am in my late teens and so is she She says she has lost her connection with me She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to But she says she still loves me Im very hurt and confused, Congrats on having your daughter  Have you told your partner about your feelings of hurt and confused  This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together in light of the change in emotional connection  The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner  Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics nbsp  Then allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other  br  This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused  It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply  If the conversations dont go very far or if your partner has no interest in talking stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters  Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation  br 
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me This rollercoaster is crazy, Yes I agree with your view about the rollercoaster sounding crazy  Concentrate on knowing what your reasons are for staying with this guy given the broad facts that you state  What are you gaining from being together and are these gains outweighing how you feel when your companion says the opposite of what he just told you  Also examine yourself for any fears of being alone  Very often people stay in detrimental relationships because of a fear that being alone will feel worse  It may initially feel this way after a breakup  This is from change itself  Eventually stability and peace of mind return and being alone with oneself is preferred to being taken on an emotional rollercoaster by a partner 
Im going through a majorly bad divorce and my wife is making things so impossible for me I need help, Crying due to a dissolution of a marriage is normal nbsp  Hating yourself may be a sign of extreme sadness feelings of loss and uncertainty  Do you know why you hate yourselfnbsp  Discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible to move from hate to selflove  Divorce signals a loss of familiar life structure and daily routines nbsp As with any meaningful loss crying is part of mourning what is soon to be gone  If you have confidence in your attorneys handling of the legal areas related to the divorce and the impossible you reference is on facing and coming to terms with statements and behaviors from your wife that you never noticed before then your best choice is to find a therapist whom you feel at ease in talking with to sort through the emotional upheaval within yourself and your everyday life and world  Divorce is a wonderful time for learning about ones own emotional needs and expectations in relationships since these are the areas currently coming apart  The good news behind losing something that seems valuable is that new space becomes open to attract what is more suitable for who you are  br 
I want us all to get along but feel that I am not being respected Of course I do have some insecurities because he was with his ex for 8 years He wants to see his step daughter and ex makes it so he has to go there to see her but she doesnt want me around She has a boyfriend but mine fixes their vehicles goes over once a week and hangs out with the ex and does family things with her Since he works nights I only see him parts of FridaySunday and we live together He wont let me use his phone when I forgot mine says his ex used to mess with it I dont think hes cheating but he will lie about what time he actually left her place to come home or about going over early to be with them I feel like the other woman She has tried to mess with holiday plans by restricting when he can see the child He only dated once person before her so this could be why I dont feel he has let go enough He is a wonderful boyfriend other than this, How much of your unhappiness with your boyfriends way of handling himself regarding his ex have you told him  The topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationship  The good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partner  There may not be any bad news depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the ex  br  Talking the matters you list may open a lot of emotion and become sidetracked very easily  A couples therapist whose focus is on the couple not either of you as individuals may be useful to you and your boyfriend so that you are able to complete your discussions without getting lost by the emotions raised 
My therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here However my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends I have loaned money to him many times and he always paid me back    I had a medical emergency last weekend and I was heavily medicated I knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me but this therapist dropped me off and never came again  I dont know what to do, Do you want this therapist to have your credit card information  If not then cancel the credit cards that you believe may now be accessible to this therapist  Therapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patient  Therapists are never friends with their patients  Letting you believe that you are the therapists friend is a violation of professional ethics and almost definitely a violation of the Consumer Protection laws in your State  Start by dropping this person as your therapist nbspHe has broken too many ethical standards to be worthy of offering therapy  Think over if youd like remaining friends with this person whom you describe as lacking integrity and stealing from you  br  If you need help getting back money from him then contact the police and talk to a detective about what has happened so far nbspThe detective will advise according to the laws in your community and State whether to file a police report and what steps are necessary to utilize the Court system to get back your funds  If youd like doing future patients who may be treated to similar ways by this therapist a favor go online and file a complaint with the therapists Licensing Board  Good luck 
I found messages between my boyfriend and this girl on social media He was asking her for naked pictures and then hung out with her once but nothing happened  I didnt find out about the messages until last month and that was six months after it happened  I cant trust him anymore and Im just wondering if I ever will He admitted that he wanted to have sex with her but he didnt He was only talking with her because he thought we were going to have a break up My heart is completely broken I feel like Im in competition with every girl on the planet for my boyfriends affection Im afraid that he doesnt like me anymore but without me hes homeless and without a car I love him so much Its been tearing me apart I dont feel pretty anymore though I dont feel good enough for anyone or anything I thought I knew him as well as I knew myself Then all of a sudden my world was flipped upside down Im still trying to figure out which way is up, Im sorry for so much stress in your relationship life  In what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you to you  From what you write you feel more aggravation stress loneliness and insecurity than satisfaction by being in this relationship  Does he care that you dont trust him  Very often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are nbspThe feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent  My suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship your boyfriend actually has  These realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didnt adequately nurture you as a child  A therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest  br 
In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and weve been separated ever since We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others  I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not  If he stops sleeping with other women can our marriage be saved Or should we just part ways  I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done  But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now  Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so, Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship nbsp  There is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage  Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or not  Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one  Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband  Love and care are not enough to make a marriage worknbsp  Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each othernbsp  That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband nbspIt intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too  Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt youre willing to tolerate and the reason youre willing to do so  From what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this  If your husband doesnt start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so  br  br 
I was married to a narcissist sociopath for 10 years  During that time I was a general manager  I used to help him financially and in other ways when we were together But things began to change  He emotionally and sexually drained me I lost my spirit I used to be a very happy person but now I am a loner  I left him and moved to another state   Currently Im working as a server which makes me believe less in myself I feel pity for myself a lot but dont know what to do When I have money problems he does not help me  He actually enjoys seeing me have a hard time in my life  I need help, Congratulations on leaving your marriage  It is ok and natural to feel sadness loss uncertainty in direction hurt resulting from ending the marriage  Possibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelings  Be kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your ex  There is very very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathy  More likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate you  Maybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotions  You were a manager once you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing so  Good luck  br 
I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes  I have problems with anger management  Apparently I also have an ODD bipolar and split personality  How can I be truly happy, The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have  You dont have to accept these words to describe who you are  A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people whats wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions  br  You can be happy because nothing from the outside such as the names people have used to tell you who you are can interfere with your own wish to be happy  Others can slow you down because of the selfdoubt and hurt feelings nbspNo one can take happiness from you only they can make it harder to find and hold onto  Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach  Think of the reason you are angry nbspThis will be better to know so you will be able to address it  Then you will not have anger to manage

My boyfriend says Im nuts I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me  Whenever I try to talk with him about it he always turns it around on me by telling me what Im doing wrong I know that accusing him does not help  When his whole demeanor shifts towards me I cant help but think that something is wrong  Am I wrong for feeling this way  I try to talk with him to make it better  I let him know when I am feeling down But I am not confident in these things   Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him  He texted her back with Sorry Ive been working  I just read your message The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me  He texted her back with Dont text me anymore  I dont feel like I am way out of the line But I cant talk with him if all that he will say is that Im crazy and I need help  What should I do  How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me, Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people  You gave examples which strongly suggest this  Quite commonly a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behavior  span stylewebkittextsizeadjust 100Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you not that youre seeing things incorrectlyspanbr  One way to check if youre totally misreading him is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships  If no one else who knows you tells you that youre crazy then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong  Also a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend  A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion what to do with your newfound clarity

How do I ever trust another woman I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions  Once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application, Im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wife  On the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful time  Maybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for example  Consider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person nbspnbsp  Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behavior  Theres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventures  Theres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again nbsp  The first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship nbsp There is no designated time line nbspYoull simply feel more ready than you feel now  Very unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering from  Good luck

I been having anger problems a lot lately It only takes one word wrongly said to set me off I use to not be like this until I got with my soontobe husband I think his mood and rageanger problems have rubbed off on me a lot I dont get nearly as bad as he does but I yell almost constantly and I cant seem to just stop I have two young babies that have to hear this and I dont want my girls growing up with a mommy like I have been lately I just dont know how to get back to my old self, My gut says that your own rage is being triggered partly because you feel trapped or shutdown by your fiances moodyangryrage responses and powerless to stop it You can start by accepting that this is who he is and you wont change him You can only change your own behaviours and I see you taking responsibility for those which is great You want to protect your girls and thats appropriate children are greatly affected by this type of home environment I urge you to see a therapist so you can understand your own emotions and sort out the choices you have to make knowing that your fiance has to make his own choices about his behavioursnbsp 
I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year He recently got a new job and travels a lot Im not used to him being gone all the time I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to  I feel lost sad and unwanted This is really a tough new challenge I just want to break up with him but I love him so much I dont know why he is acting this way lately I believe I have separation anxiety Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town, In a way yes you have separation anxiety Its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection So just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it meansthat hes forgotten about you or loves you less It could mean quite the oppositethat hes focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you He may think hes loving you more but you feel loved less You have two jobs to do here The first is to manage your anxiety by talking back to the thoughts it puts into your head It sounds like Its normal to be insecure but I have tons of evidence that he loves me and that I mean the world to him Find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim The second part of your job is to let him know what you need You need more affection and connection during this period when hes away more texts phone calls information Its okay to want that and I am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when hes awaynbspbr 
Im a teenager I get random spurts of anger like complete pure rage I figured it was hormones but others notice it too I get selfdestructive I used to cut but stopped Now when I get mad I bite my arms and fingers pull my hair scratch my face or punch my thighs Basically I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom I dont live in a bad household I have a great family a great relationship with my boyfriend and a good job I have no idea what this is and I dont know how to control it Its over any little thing Tonight it was because I couldnt get my earrings out This happens maybe two to three times on a good week and its always over stupid petty things, Hi Im glad you wrote In general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively You say that your behaviours are self destructive and I agree It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you Again a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm Your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified helpnbsp 
He said he would try and he never did Its been nine months and this is making me worse Today he said I have to respect whatever decision he makes Is that true Am I supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what Im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night Hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out, Im sorry for the hurt youre feeling from your husbands decision  Keep in mind that if one partner does not want to be in a relationship and remains in it then both people will be unhappy dissatisfied and feel stressed  Imagine being in a relationship that youd rather leave  All the negative feelings and resentment of being with someone whom youd rather be without would not leave very much energy to satisfy your partner  Im glad you realize that you feel depressed  Depression is a mood that can change once you understand what is causing it  Depression is an area that very often therapists help their patients understand and emotionally support and encourage them during the course this takes  For now concentrate on decreasing the tension in your life nbspYour husbands indecision may very well be adding to your stress  Only he can make up his own mind  As hard as this may be all you really can do is take care of how you feel so that you will feel better  From what you write your husband is too unsure to offer you the love and care youd like from him  Learning to love oneself is always worthwhile nbsp At this stage in your marriage now sounds like an ideal opportunity for you to teach yourself selflove  br 
My new daughterinlaw just informed me that she is smoking marijuana while pregnant because of her morning sickness Im in shock and I dont know how to respond I just lost my mom and she was good with advice, Have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these regarding the topic nbspnbsp  When you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinions  Plan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in law  Since your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child he may also be interested in being part of this conversation  Also during your discussion find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in law  It is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels better  Maybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky way  Sending Good luck

Ive been hospitalized twice Once was last month for psychiatric help Im on medicine but Im struggling with fighting the negative thoughts irrational fears and loneliness The people around me arent helping much, If you are someone who usually has a job pays or contributes to household bills and generally manages your own daily life then here are some suggestions  Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happinessbr  Since the people whom you currently are in your life arent helping much consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you  Follow your natural interests nbspIf you like reading look online for a local book club nbsp If you like watching birds look up a bird watching group  Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings  Also the way healthcare is set up in the US psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script nbsp nbspThere is almost no human interest in the person  If youd like feeling better as a person then find people nbsp Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady  br  If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization then similar advice is still valid  Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis 
I find myself being very outgoing most of the time but there are some times when I dont know what to say I dont even want to talk at all Its like I search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out I dont know if Im outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say I dont know if people like that about me Im very selfconscious and always think people are talking about me so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk, Would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation you simply listened attentively to the other people  This way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as well  Maybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focus  Start by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you are  Maybe you simply need new and different groups

My toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training He almost throws up every time he sees his poop He gags and will not go on the toilet We have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it When he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee He holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper I dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him How can I help him get over this fear and passed the stress, Your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained You dont say how old he is so Im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step Pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so I suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again In general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positivelynbsp

My husband and I wouldve been married for five years come June 2016 Our infant daughter just had her birthday Shortly before he told me he wanted a divorce He has four other children three of which are from his first wife He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant The children do not have a good relationship with him now He has another child from a woman he was dating He decided he didnt want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant     It seems to me that there is a pattern He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older Ive tried to research online but Im not getting any answers He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder He also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals Is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have Where do you recommend researching this,This sounds really difficult and I can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children With that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for In order for someone to be diagnosed with a a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesarticleshowdoiknowifihaveamentalillnessmental illnessa or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapycouplestherapymarriagecounsellingpatterns in relationshipa  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do nbspWhile it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choicesnbsp
I was raped repeatedly when I was younger I told my parents and action was taken but now that Im an adult I suffer from extreme anxiety, While anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life When we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come This is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially This fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again However as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety In order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life I would encourage you to seek professional help and check out a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesvideosadditionaltherapyresourcesanxiety resources aonline nbsp

I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life I had a daughter with my exboyfriend I am now married and my husbands exgirlfriend is involved with my exboyfriend  They also have a daughter together My issue is that there is always drama I am pregnant and I told my exboyfriend that I dont want any drama or arguments I want to get along as much as possible and he agreed However we just had an incident where my exboyfriend started discussing dropoff details about my stepdaughter I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter That led to an argument I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter My stepdaughters pickup details are between my husband and his exgirlfriend I especially told him I didnt want to be involved Somehow he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him    The point is there is so much drama I try my best to get along with everyone I dont understand where I went wrong besides replying back to his question I feel like Im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other and its the children that are hurting I had a party planned for my daughters birthday and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her In my eyes its the child that is hurting I was throwing a party for her birthday and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter which I have no control over he took it out on our daughter, Hi I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the childrennbspChildren need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing Your exboyfriendnbspseems more focused on his own needs In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation I agree this is a problem  I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress Honour this instinct you havenbsp  I will suggest a few things to you First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter It will help you feel supported  Know that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him You cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression Youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation  Keep on defining clear boundaries You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessary  Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict  A professional therapist can help you with all of this I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself   br 
After 25 years I fell in love for the first time The person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye My heart is burning and I cant take this pain, Hi San DiegonbspIm sad that this was your first experience in 25 years with feeling in love You deserve better My understanding of todays western social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone youve been seeing without explanation I dont get it Its rude Youre better off without this person around There are still people who operate with respect but this person isnt one of them  span stylelineheight 142857If Im reading this right you knew this person for a week In my humble opinion much heartache and many poornbsprelationships come from attaching too soon It takes years to get to know someone deeply I know its hard to keep yourself from falling in love but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happensspanbr  If I was your therapist Id be curious about how this is the first time youve fallen in love Or is it that you were in love 25 years ago nbspWas your heart broken then or did something encourage your heart to close What has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now Is there a danger that you will decide love isnt worth the risk This is a crucial time for you to potentially seek professional support from a therapist in order to understand yourself and not shut down if thats what happened before br 
Every once and a while I think about my exboyfriend from four years ago and my current friend Its like I cant get past it and I need some kind of closure I keep thinking about how we had something but it got cut off due to parental intervention Nothing was ever wrong with it Now weve become friends but theres this huge sexual tension between us or at least I feel it when were physically in the same place    Two summers ago we saw each other casually for a while but we never had sex then or while we were dating which was only for two months three years ago Im now in my 20s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s Despite the age difference I know were a really good match Weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out I tell him everything Also my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well Hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing That summer I told him I didnt want anything serious and broke it off Only a week later he had gotten back together with his girlfriend His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited Im sure she may be different around him but I worry about him committing to her in the long run Theyre supposed to move in together soon But still I feel this connection with my exboyfriend and I feel like he does too     I dont know what to do I need some closure or Im not going to be able to move on from this I dont know what it is but its driving me crazy Im so happy with my current boyfriend and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling Hes such a good person I also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but I cant get it out of my head Im trying to take a nap right now between classes but I cant sleep because my mind is racing Ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever    I want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but I dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face If he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me If my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed On one hand I want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too Where would I go from there On the other hand I feel like I cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but I dont want to    Please help me because I really have no idea what to do, If youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that Although you say youre happy Id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need Is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason Thats a pretty important element to be missing  It may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex If you feel the need to see what is possible there I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first You cant have everything  If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship The grass isnt greener A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future

For the last year my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting Im at my wits end How can I get them to stop and get along, That is a good question Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one Kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with themnbsp  These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each othernbsp  One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are If this doesnt work it may be time to get a a hrefhttpsnatromansquarespacecomconfigpagestherapycounsellingpsychotherapycouplestherapymarriagecounsellingfamily therapist aor counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflictnbsp

My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isnt I have full access to his phone social media and emails I never find anything but Im obsessed with constantly checking just in case How do I stop this Its driving a wedge between us, Hi Greenville I respect that youre owning your own overreactions and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves The truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trusted  The answer here is in two different areas Basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behaviours  Your thoughts are stuck like tires in deep ruts in the road These thoughts are only habits they dont reflect the truth Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats or  youre not enough for him Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be muchperhaps none and what is the evidence that doesnt support it I know lots of good men I know I deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity Youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear Thats the first half Practise these thoughts  The rest of the work is in your behaviours Act as though you trust him Force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel Acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe it  Its possible to change the way we think and this is turn changes the way we feel Try this to start and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it Good luck

I have an eating disorder of binging Ive had gastric sleeve surgery I need help with issues of abuse as a child addiction and abusive men I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist, Hi Anaheim  Relationships with therapists have some things in common with other relationships they work best if there is dialogue about what your hopes thoughts emotions and needs are Are you letting your therapist know what your goals are Its okay to say Id really like us to focus on this piece or Im looking for specific direction about how to manage this part Your therapist is wise if they ask questions that determine what your needs are but they cant read your mindnbsp  Not every therapist will be a good fit for you I know Im not a good fit for everyone I meet We have different styles some are more nbsppassive and focus on listening This might be the type of therapist you have For some people this is what they want but maybe its not for you Maybe you want someone who digs at you more asks more questions gives you strategies lets you know what they think someone more active If this is the case it doesnt mean shes a bad therapistits just not what youre looking fornbsp  Sometimes people think they cant end sessions with their therapist they might be worried about hurt feelings But in the end you dont owe your therapist anything if you feel its not working or its not a good match Just move on and try someone new Maybe ask them questions first about their style evennbsp  Best of luck 
My fianc doesnt think I trust him because I was cheated on before However he hides his phone and has been texting his exgirlfriend who he has two kids with What should I do, Oh Chino I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious Theres a chicken and an egg and I dont know which came first One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children Can you accept thatnbsp  When suspicion and insecurity come along your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture Is there any real evidence that he is cheating Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids Has he earned your trust If so then its not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others Hes not your ex Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports thatnbsp  At the same time you can let him know what your triggers are For example hiding his phone doesnt send you a good message rightnbspSee this is the chicken and the eggis he hiding the phone because youve been overreacting when he gets a textnbsp So let him know you wont blow up about him getting a text if he doesntnbspconceal or password his phone Transparency helps build trust You have sensitivities and it helps you a lot if hes aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fearnbsp  Let him know when you get scared and hopefully hell give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him nbsp 
I am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the United States I faced a cultural shock and I was so depressed when I arrived here My counselor in the university was my savior He helped me a great deal Now I am going back to my country for a vacation I was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and I remembered that he likes wine My country is known for that Is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after Christmas, Hinbsp  Different therapists are guided by the ethical guidelines of their own associations or colleges when it comes to receiving gifts so this may differ a bit from therapist to therapist Its important to me that I be sensitive to cultural norms and to my clients needs In Canada and the US it is customary for people to sometimes express gratitude with a small gift and I have from time to time received small tokens of appreciation because I believe it would be rude to refuse this It is never necessary to give a therapist a gift but if you wish to express your gratitude in this way I dont think its inappropriatenbsp 
A friend of mine taking psychology advised I go to my doctor to check if I have major depressive disorder Im afraid of the consequences of doing so If I do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder wont that go on my records I will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things I may be prohibited from Im also afraid of taking any antidepressants This year my doctor gave me some for a dislocated hip I had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them Everyone I know who has taken antidepressants says its a bad idea all around and youre better getting treatment without them Im concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because I am unable to make decisions on my own Im not really suicidal but I am not really taking care of myself either Someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy Im not keen on that Im wondering if I am better off just getting selfhelp and working things out on my own Its just that Ive been an emotional mess since I was in elementary school Ive graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy but I cannot deny I still am not good, I admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants nbspQuestioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a person  As a therapist I always tell my patients to avoid antidepressants  Their effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings nbspIf someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from others  Antidepressants mask how someone feels  In a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful nbspIf someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then nbspsuppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short while  Basically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants nbsp Your view is shared by many nbsp It is a minority opinion and very validnbsp  If you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressants  Ideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic  I hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search 
I was mentored by this guy for a few years spiritually It was okay at times but other times it was just weird I try not to think about it too much but a lot of manipulation and lying happened yet no one else really believed me when I told them Its like hes two different people and no one else really sees that side of him I was blamed for a lot of our troubles and now we dont really talk much Im worried because hes in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything They just think Im attacking his character How do I know for sure, You may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understood  Just Google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these roles  Theoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths nbsp  Well yes nbsp  And I consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people nbspBeing able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you have  Psychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopaths  I agree with you about not being able to change peoples minds who are attached to this persons interactions  The only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authorities  No one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths 
When I see something I dont like I go off like a ticking time bomb I go from 0 to 100 really quickly, Sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions Typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing When faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6 while focusing and thinkingnbsponly about your breathing After doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate Good luckbr 
I just got out of a two year relationship I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasnt showing any affection at all He was talking to other women and lying about it It pushed me away and hurt me but Im still in love with him A couple days after our breakup he was talking to someone new He told me he wasnt sure if he loved me I cried for several days lost my appetite and couldnt sleep Our whole relationship was only us We didnt have friends It was me and him against the world We didnt talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night Then when I cut myself we talked on Skype He cried and told me Im still in love with you I never stopped loving you and I cried tears of joy I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasnt just saying that because of me being so depressed He promised and assured me he loved me He came over after that and we had sex because he wanted to He went the home that night and told me he didnt love me and he lied because he was scared He told me I wasnt attractive I wasnt beautiful to him and that I changed He also told me he was 100 sure hed never love me again Im still in love with him Why do I love him How do I stop Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me That I wasnt good enough and that Im no longer beautiful hurts me I think I need a therapist but dont know if I should, I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering Losing the mostnbspsignificant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside With that being said seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous supportnbspmay be necessary for healing to take place Anytimenbspsadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm it is important to get help immediatelynbspA therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are goingnbspthrough while also working with you to move through the grieving process adopt new hobbies social outlets and goals for your future While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting tasknbspit will only make things easier and give you anbspsense of hope and purpose for your future With the new year right around the corner this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals relatednbspto living a more fullfilling life Hang in there Withnbspa support system in place and a healthy mindset things can only get easiernbspBest of luck to younbspnbspbr 
I am always arguing with my father He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling I get upset often at this Am I too sensitive He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings No matter how often I try to tell him this he never listens, Thanks for the question Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context Begin your statements withnbspI as opposed to you For example you can tell him I feel angry whennbspyou raise your voice at me instead of Younbspalways yell at me Also avoid using black and white terms such as never and always Additionally offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you Maybe he just doesnt know how tonbspLastly when delivering a message I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussionnbspwith something postive and ending it with something postive For example you may say something to the effect of  Dad Inbspenjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion There are times thatnbspI feel angry when you talk to me aggressively Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics Lets try and work on this together I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm  I hope you find this usefulbr 
Im in a longdistance relationship with my ideal man but Im not as attracted to him as I should be Everything else is perfect about him but I find myself lusting over more attractive men The next step is marriage but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again However I also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust Am I asking for too much in the perfect guy Is there such a thing Am I truly in love, Hi Montgomerynbsp  Your first sentence says it all He might be an amazing person but theres something missing for you Im curiousyou say this is a long distance relationship Did you make a connection through social media or email first Maybe a dating website Im just wondering if this is the case These modern ways of meeting people are awesome because we can be exposed to a wide variety of people who we never would meet in the grocery store or a friends party There are complications though and one of the drawbacks is you can feel very connected to someone and care about them a great deal before you ever meet them in person Then when you finally meet them and there isnt that spark of magnetic physical attraction youre in a bit of a difficult spot because youve already established that youre drawn to each other in other ways youre already connected It can be very awkward then to say Now that I meet you it doesnt feel the way it should for me In the future I suggest meeting up in person early on to answer that crucial question Are we physically attracted to each other Clearly this is not only important for you but it is for most of us  My guess is that you feel you owe this man your affection and commitment even though youre not really all that into him lusting after other men is a sign of that because you like absolutely everything else about him But honesty is crucial here both with yourself and this man Just because you dont find yourself attracted to him doesnt mean that youre a bad person or that hes not attractive Someone else might drool over him and I think he deserves someone who does just that You can have both love and lust For most people only one of them isnt enough  br  br 
My husband doesnt trust me for some past we had I know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over that I am messing around which I am not, Hi Louisiana  Its normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time His reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt againnbsp  Youre a bit vague about the past You dont say whether you cheated or not If you did then you might try taking an approach where you a take responsibility for your past actions b show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that c do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority and d reassure him when he says hes scared or feeling insecure Im suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that youre so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear This is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury  Part of the issue might be that when he brings it up hes coming across as angry accusing or suspicious rather than scared and insecure This often happens A therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger which is also natural but less helpful in those moments and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure himnbsp  As much as you want to forget about it he might need to talk about it sometimes and thats normal His needs are important Also important however is your need for respect If he approaches it in a disrespectful way thats a separate problem If its brought up as a weapon used to shut you down or used to control or punish those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts You can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the past  A qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory Best of luck

Ive worked with this guy for about three years now and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted Over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on There was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out We agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind I hoped it would become something more It didnt and three months later Im still not over it    Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants Were no longer in the same office which I thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so Im still very drawn to him Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested Hes younger than me and prefers model types but I see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship, It sounds like a tricky situation If you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him getting over him may not be possible What makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible Some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light If you truly want to force yourself to get over him cutting contactnbspor setting strict boundaries may be necessary If you dont see him over time you can begin to forget about him If you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches you will not feel mislead ornbsphave the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interestednbspIt would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelingsnbspto change Thus being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him Good lucknbspbr 
My husband doesnt trust me for some past we had I know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes I feel I am getting tired of the same thing over and over that I am messing around which I am not, The good news in the way youre feeling is recognizing that your husbands trust of your actions makes a difference to you  The typical therapy formula for restoring trust between two people after some sort of betrayal is for the one who has broken the trust to earn it back  Restoring trust requires both persons to actively involve themselves in this process  The person who tires earning back trust must know what standards for this of the one who was betrayed  The person who feels betrayed must willingly be open minded to accepting the efforts of the one who tries earning back their trust  As simple as this formula sounds the actual process of restoring trust raises a lot of emotion on both sides therefore causing difficulty in keeping discussions in this area on track  The best way of success in restoring trust between partners is utilizing a couples therapist who would be able to guide your conversations back on track and also open emotions for discussion when relevant to restoring trust  Good luck in establishing new terms with your partner

Im a male in my 20s My girlfriend is in her late 30s Shes great Shes funny and smart she has a big heart and we have an excellent sex life She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go We fight a lot Its mostly my fault I must admit She doesnt like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her I have trust issues Also I cant fathom why a woman like her is with me so Im always dreading when a better dude will come along I dont think shes happy Shes very submissive and she loves me very much but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay I love her so much but my jealousy is not likely to diminish I never believed in the whole If you love them let them go but I do now I really want her to be happy Should I end it with her She has no place to go so I feel like I cant break up with her Im literally trapped,It sounds like there are assumptions being made regarding how she feels about you and why she is with you I would not suggest breaking up with her without first attempting to resolve your own issues You may not only regret your decision but might find that the exact same problem arises in future relationships I would recommend seeing a therapist who can help you figure out what is at the root of all of this By learning about your own insecurities and where they come from you can expect to discover new ways of responding and relating to others which will likely impact your relationship in a positive manner
I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately Whenever I get close to being in a relationship some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit While a semirelationship should be joyous for me its an emotional nightmare I cant get to the bottom of Ive had this before and had to leave the semirelationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush What could be the reason behind this Is it massive nerve problems Is it a fear of a bad relationship    While Im not quite ready to be in one anyway I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one I dont take medications and have no desire to I have read forums and Ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems, Hi Helena  I felt a bit sad when I read this This is a new term for me semirelationship What does it mean I know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore That makes me feel sad I hear a lot of young women Im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup Research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty I think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end  This is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect that  Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety Anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions What am I afraid of What is the worst thing that might happen here Then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen Might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurt  Then when you find that core fear you can look at your life and I bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt In the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious But this doesnt work for you Good With the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence 
I had to go to the emergency room today to get an Xray of my spine My boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me Instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while I waited When I was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up He doesnt understand why Im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things He thinks I dont have a reason to be mad but I believe that I do, Hi Moore Underneath all your anger is a lot of hurt The hurt is there because you are being disrespected Your boyfriend unless youve only told me a small disproportionate part of the bigger picture doesnt tend to treat you like youre important and he dismisses your emotions This is happening because this is the level of ability disability he has right now in a relationship You can expect more of this behaviour because thats who he is it has nothing to do with you and I hope you think carefully about whether its working for you to be in thisnbsp  You could try telling him that you are hurt because people tend to listen more to hurt than to anger but my guess is with him it might not make a difference I hope you talk to someone who knows and supports you about how youre feeling in this relationshipnbsp 
I just got married with my husband I have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids I am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his Now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past I know all marriages have problems but sometimes I feel its not going to work out if theres no trust Its hard for me to let go because I love him but I am getting tired, Hi Louisiana  You say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past You dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationship  Trust is the first stage in a relationship Moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element But you didnt see this coming did you Thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surfacenbsp  I give you credit for wanting it to work and I believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust Good luck

Im supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life but Ive never liked it here not even before I came Ive never felt like I belong Ive missed my country every second in the past four months and Im just miserable Im gaining weight doing nothing and crying for hours straight Is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock, It sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting Without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home it is hard to say what you should do however I think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answerbr 
Hello I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city I know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed     I have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship     What can I do, It sounds like you are feeling pretty criticized by your cousin and at the same time you are wondering whether or not there is some truth in what she is saying It also sounds like you would like to see if you can find a new way to relate to your cousin so that your relationship can be more satisfying If you can find a competent therapist to work with there may be a great deal of opportunity to learn more about how you relate to people in the world and to learn strategies to show up in your relationship with your cousin in a way that feels right to youbr 
Ive worked with this guy for about three years now and I knew the first time I saw him that I was attracted Over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on There was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out We agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind I hoped it would become something more It didnt and three months later Im still not over it    Im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants Were no longer in the same office which I thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so Im still very drawn to him Hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so I find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested Hes younger than me and prefers model types but I see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope How do I get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship, It sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations  which is understandable On the one hand you want to get over him on the other you are still holding out hope for something more It will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more If you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system  that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him If you are wholeheartedly committed to moving past the a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesarticleswhatissextherapysexual and romantic parts of your relationshipa and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start It is hard to just be friends when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veinsnbsp

That phrase makes me crazy It happens anytime I point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his iPad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that I got all the things he needs to bake a pie Another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up Over and over again he lets the dog run out and I am afraid he will get hit by a car, I empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to him  When the immediate situation has calmed down nbsphave you ever told him that this upsets you nbsp  Is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to you  Keep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to change  A helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happened  By learning more about how the other person thinks and feels it will be easier to know what to expect form each other  Even if you disagree about what is best knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept or at least not be surprised and startled by them  Sending good luck to both of you

People who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so It makes me feel like Im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me I have had jobs but I am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong Any time I bring these things up I am expected to be over the issue These are people that you cant just cut out but I have never received apologies for so much of my pain I dont know what to do any more I dont know who I am anymore, It sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued In working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to youbr

My fiance suffers from severe anxiety and depression She has had it most of her life Her anxiety in public places is the worst It gets to points where she cant breathe or move Sometimes she wont even go to the restroom so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks She wont eat or drink in public If she isnt having a panic attack or crying shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I cant even get her to eat drink leave the bed or go outside She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds yelling conflict and even talking to strangers in public She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her She is so scared that I cant even get her to drive She doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive    Some people have recommended medication but I believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it I dont want my fiance pumped with drugs I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her When we first met my poodle it would calm her down a lot She took the dog out every time we went out and she seemed much calmer and happier She slowly would eat and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better I am worried and want to help her without medication, It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues Based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation Whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts You would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling andnbspbest learn how to support her and your relationship I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later

I feel that I need to end my present relationship He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month  I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion Lately he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks I told him that I cant continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want We have been together 7 years The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like We have gone through this cycle already 45 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile, It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner are pretty overwhelming A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to youbr

I like getting attention from men I dont have sex I lead them on to thinking I might want to I like to tease I like for men to chase me and I like to feel wanted, Hi Michigan Good for you for recognising a destructive pattern This behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone Thats a powerful thought You are certainly acting as if this is true If you believed in your value as a person you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in generalnbsp  If I were your therapist Id have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from Id suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour Good luck

I never get infections or scars or anything and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something but Im concerned, Hi Houston The fact that youre concerned says a lot If I was your therapist Id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life Youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage to your body and its likely youre trying to express somethingpain maybe A therapist can help you to explore whats going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way Good luck

I have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and I just had my first kiss five months ago Im worried that at this rate I wont have a boyfriend for a very long time The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time I dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them Luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me I feel dirty by doing this but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal    Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking I am tall I play lots of sports and I get excellent grades in school I am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest It bothers me Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already I feel like I will be single forever sometimes, I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is whats the rush nbspJust because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that theres something wrong or something to be ashamed of nbspIf anything I want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it nbspbrbrOne of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective Its important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals nbspOnce you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall downnbsp

My mom and I have been fighting a lot now and I just want a good relationship with her, The best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively nbspOne of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blamenbsp  The best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response nbspOften the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication The hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such timesnbsp 
I have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and I just had my first kiss five months ago Im worried that at this rate I wont have a boyfriend for a very long time The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time I dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them Luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me I feel dirty by doing this but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal    Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking I am tall I play lots of sports and I get excellent grades in school I am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest It bothers me Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already I feel like I will be single forever sometimes, It is very hard to want a loving relationship and either see or imagine all around you the great times other couples are having Extra hard is that other peoples comments may start giving you the sense that you are letting them down to not have a relationship  All the fantasies that develop from viewing Facebook photos and imagining everyone or most people in ideal relationships just augments any frustration of not being part of this group  Your post sounds like youre being true to yourself and honoring who you are really by developing clear standards of what youd expect from a relationship  For the longterm whatever develops in your relationship life you will always be able to look back and know you had selfintegritynbspbr  By being your natural self youre being attractive nbspnbsp  Probably very unlikely that a young woman who would like a relationship will never have one  Maybe the young men in your school are not yet emotionally mature enough to know how to see and appreciate you  Even though it may be hard have patience with bringing in someone who is good for you nbsp  And continue your keen insight of yourself because it is guiding you to be the best in all areas of living  Sending good luck in all areas  br 
I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now In the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating We argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work I used to party a lot and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else These situations were never more than just kissing I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me I love him so much and want to work things out too but Im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me I cant seem to forgive myself Im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness, Hi Cerritos  This is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness You are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actionsnbsp  My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made You dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man You only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made Were you shamed as a child Did you learn that you deserved to be punished Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for The bar is too high for you If I was your therapist I would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that woundnbsp  If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself Forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymorenbsp  You have done many things here that you can feel proud of Youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth You are acting very honourably Its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now Its not our mistakesnot our worst moments that define usits how we handle them afterwards  I wish you growth and happiness 
When Im not cutting Im drinking When I try healthy outlets such as exercise I end up running myself down into an asthma attack From weapons to words I cant help but self harm What am I supposed to do how do I stop this cycle I dont know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain, It sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control you are concerned about your behavior and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it In working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic selfbr 
Its not entirely true to say I enjoy being sad but I always find a way to feel that way I listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel I focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or I just make it seem negative, It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why This may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way A simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using Now I am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitbr  One thing I would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content Id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings These are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapistbr 
I have an exboyfriend who just lies about everything He is super lazy He lies to everyone that he has a good job builds trust and then start borrowing moneyand large amounts too It has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends He is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story borrow money then disappear He refuses to work so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends I used to think his lying was due to his drug habit but now Im hearing from other exfriends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life He would borrow anywhere from 5000 to 50000 from everyone and it would all disappear Hes in debt with bills He doesnt gamble but he spends his money on random stuff    Although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money he seems to be a good person Hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what My brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother He takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him He drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being Is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there, It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another One question that I would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist Another question I would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without himbr 
About two and a half months ago I met a woman on a dating site We went out on two dates and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date We respectfully tried not to have sex but after hours of trying to resist each other we gave in and we had sex After that I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks Then one day she went to her familys house on Thanksgiving and everything changed Within the short time we were together we got so close and serious really fast We had finally found each other We told each other that we loved each other all the time even while we were making love A few days after Thanksgiving she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently I was very hurt and didnt understand Then another week later she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore I was crushed    A few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that Then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her So for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen She had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused She doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly I know she needs time and all I can do is take care of myself We have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again Im completely in love with her and Im in extreme pain, Love doesnt hurt  Your description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this woman  In some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care about  This sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one nbsp  Your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long term  Try distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday life  Being aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledge  Your ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of love  The relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes nbspIt sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in reality  Good luck 
I have major depression severe PTSD anxiety disorder and personality disorder I had an appointment with my doctor I was very upset and I shared with him about that particular drug, Your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safety  It was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on nbspI know that must have been difficult to talk about with him nbsp  span stylewebkittextsizeadjust 100By having that conversation you are helpingnbspspanspan stylewebkittextsizeadjust 100your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your healthspan 
An organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies The study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare I lost my kids my job and all that I was an unwilling participant I no longer trust a therapist  Im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything, Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable There is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause br  I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again br  If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress Some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy You may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstaclebr 
Im an early 20 something yearold virgin and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids Hes cheated on me twice once in the beginning and then four months ago He wasnt use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasnt sure We both work at the same job where we met and its with the girl that works with us Ive been trying to get over it but now my confidence and selfesteem are low and sometimes I feel like hell do it again or that hes not ready to be with me I think about it all over again when I see her He says hes in love with me and with the last time he cheated it didnt feel right and thats when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me Hes contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because hes in a relationship with me    How do I gain confidence Should I let him go If I let him go I dont want to be sad about it being that we work together I try to tell myself Im beautiful every day and I think I am a pretty attractive female with a great personality but I dont like the fact that she works there, Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationship  Youre on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend  Since he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trust  This is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelity  Understand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationship  If yes then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationship  For example some people who are getting over being cheated on would like knowing details about the affair person some people want to see the phone of the one who cheated  Recuperating after a cheating incident takes many months  If he tells you hed like earning back your trust give him some time to see if there is progress in this area  As results unfold you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally taking  About the girl at work she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationship  She has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to take  As you go along this road more than likely youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you  br 
I have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back This past time it was extremely debilitating so I went on Wellbutrin I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week A month and a half later I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away However I still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and I have days where I feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine,Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well While I cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication If you can find a doctor psychiatrist or ARNP who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with thembrbrOne thing that I am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group While there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge differencebr
My husband and I have been together since high school We have been married going on for nearly ten years and we have three beautiful children A few weeks ago my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dads for a while He comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong Can this marriage be saved or is it too late He said he would go to counseling so I dont think he has given up, While it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support With appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible Im not familiar with the resources available in Jackson but Im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapynbsp  So often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment I commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children The following links provides more information regarding a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesarticlesthesesimpleinteractionspredictlastingloveorseparationanddivorcecommon behaviours that predict staying together or separatinganbspand also a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesvideosadditionaltherapyresourcesvideos and other resources athat can help you get startednbspWishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discoverynbsp

I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now In the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating We argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work I used to party a lot and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else These situations were never more than just kissing I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me I love him so much and want to work things out too but Im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me I cant seem to forgive myself Im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness, So wonderful to have a boyfriend who is able to understand and forgive you What do you think that he sees in you that allows him to do that Does he see someone who like other humans makes mistakes Does he see someone who despite hurtful choices is a good person committed to being a loving respectful partner The compassion and understanding that we can often extend to others can be difficult to extend to ourselvesnbsp  We often hold very unrealistic and perfectionist expectations for ourselves which may even lead to our poor choices in the first place  as a ways of letting off steam or rebelling against our high standards Regardless of the reasons we all make mistakes and imperfection does not make someone less loveable  it just makes them human If your boyfriend is able to start clean with you there must be a reasonnbsp  What you do from here on out will define the kind of partner you are to him Can you treat him with the kind of respect that you would want Can you help him to feel a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesarticlesthesesimpleinteractionspredictlastingloveorseparationanddivorceloved and safe in the relationshipa Can you allow yourself to be imperfect and afraid and still worthy of love and acceptance When you are feeling ashamed of your behaviours  try to imagine extending that scared part of you the same love and acceptance that you might extend to other people who have made mistakes It is not easy to forgive ourselves but it is important in order to allow ourselves to be loved and to truly love othersnbsp

I dont know whats with me Im almost constantly angry Even when Im happy I still feel anger inside me When I acknowledge it it ruins my mood and takes over I get angry at the littlest things Even if I think someone said something they didnt it infuriates me Something perfectly normal can make me go off When my anger flares up I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while Its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body and anger is gasoline, Hi Nashville Im glad you want this to be different It doesnt feel good to be angry all the time and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships Im sure  Working with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger Its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing thatnbsp  So when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something youd rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is In that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face or the shoe that someone left in front of the doorits that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on fire  I suggest finding a therapist to work with You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them   br 
My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and I cant seem to forgive her I want to say that its okay but I cant I feel like even if I did forgive her I wouldnt be able to say it to her face, Hi Cleveland I think I get what youre feeling Youre scared that if you forgive your mom that would mean it wasnt so bad or shell think its okay to do it again or she wont realize how hurt you arenbsp  I invite you to look at forgiveness in a different way Forgiveness doesnt have to mean what she did was okay Not at all Forgiveness can mean I accept what she did and I dont want to live in her worst moments constantly I want to put it down and move past it because I want her in my life because fear and resentment interfere with my relationship with her and mostly because Im tired of carrying them fear and resentment around constantly  You can forgive your mom for yourself not for hernbspnbspIf there is evidence that your mom wants to respect you moving forward then it might be worth it to risk putting down the resentment and the grudge that you think you need to protect yourselfnbspnbspYour ability to draw boundaries with her in the present is your biggest protector let her know in the present what hurts you and notice her responses  You dont have to say it to her face Saying it to yourself is more important Again forgiving your mom helps youit reduces your own burden of fear and resentment leaving space for better thingsnbsp 
My exhusband told my two adolescents that Santa doesnt exist on the day before Christmas They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas but I dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real I dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but I also dont want to lose their trust, Well Boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years which is unusual I believe I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway  But they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best So its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways Really who says they have to stop believing in Santa Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and lovenbsp 
I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful He has since had a rebound relationship He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me He says its going to be too difficult to see me Every time we talk it feels like Im being pushy to see him He used to be so madly in love with me but now it seems like he couldnt care less I think Im running him away, Hi Kansas  I think your first instinct was good you broke up with him You deserve respect but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship Its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants which is spacenbsp  Do you think hes going to be any different with her This a common unfounded fear we havenbspI wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him Thenbspbottomnbspline is you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone be loving towards you because how someone treats you and the choices they make has everything to do with who they are and nothing to do with who you are I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future

Ive been with my husband for eight years now We have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated I took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes However we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again During that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child    The baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too He said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since Even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual Being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything He said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right I would still accuse him Hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because Im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life    Im of course hurt and in shock I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go my heart will still be torn apart I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought, Hi Jayuya Im struggling in this moment with my own biases I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect Your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours And now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are there  So my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that and I dont think either of those things will help you Id like to ask you some questions though  Are you happy Do you know what happy is Do you know what respect is Are your children safe Are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe Do you have supports Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life Have you ever been to a womens shelter Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly Thats what I suggest These are big decisions you deserve some support I wish you the best

I am so angry I feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress and I dont know what to do I want to sit down with a psychologist but I cannot afford one nor do I have my own health insurance I can feel myself starting to get violent I throw things of value when I start to get mad I have punched holes in my wall I can feel my aggression getting worse, First off it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope withnbsplifes obstacles including anger management There are several strategies that you can try tonbsphelp control your anger but thenbspones thatnbspI would recomend first are the following  1nbspTry a different way of communicating with your parents Sincenbsparguing withnbspthem is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefitnbspChoose a time to talk with themnbspabout heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened Use I phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on themnbspValidate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view  2 When you feel yourself becoming angry take a break Simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing Close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhalenbspeven slower counting to 6 Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes  3 Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks Often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts  4 Finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry  I wish you all the bestbr 
I have bipolar II disorder Im addicted to alcohol and weed and Im hopeless I keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,The first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change nbspFrequently our problems keep us in denial nbspAlthough feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone nbspdivbrdivdivThe best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together nbspAlcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction nbspKnow also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needednbspdivdivbrdivdivI really recommend an inpatient stay for at least 30 days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not nbspIf this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an Intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues nbspdivdivbrdivdivKnow that there is hope for what you are experiencing nbspYou can get control over these issues nbspThe next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do itnbspdivdivbrdiv
My boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend He goes to see her twice a week or more Every time she leaves he gets into these funks like when his mom died When shes here shes disrespectful and his answer is Well I dont know what to tell you She swears and talks back and he laughs He and her mom have been apart for three years and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young We never have adult time when shes not here Shes the golden child and he wont listen to anyone, Hi Lockport Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky You dont tell us whether you live together or not If you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the homenbsp  A bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent Thats for your boyfriend to decide When hes there hes the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that hes not seeing its simply not for you to interfere therenbsp  It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned Do you talk about these things Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to do  Although I suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if hes open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you It makes sense to say I see you struggling and I dont know how to help Ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her Are you aware that its coming across this way Do you need help or I feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone togethernbsp  span stylelineheight 142857You sound a bit resentful of his daughter Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childspan  span stylelineheight 142857You have a voice and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel Ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it spanbr

Just wondering if this is a deviant act and if I should be concerned for him He isnt quite 10, Well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm Its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so I would wonder if this child is trying to say something  I think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on If there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properlynbsp

Ever since my exboyfriend and I broke up I cant seem to get close to anyone else I know Im completely over him but I just cant break down my walls and let someone new into my life, Hi Bend Youre scared right That makes sense Each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt Who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines 90 of our happiness in lifenbsp  The good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and thats okay We are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls So part of what I want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow   As well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right personnbsp  First think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship What do you feel proud of What do you need in a partner What mistakes did you make Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner  Look at your thoughts Are you having generalized negative thoughts like No one will ever love me again or Im going to get hurt again or I cant trust myself If so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought What is the evidence that I am lovable that there are safe good people out there that I can trust myself Eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones Its simple but very powerful  Lastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls What is the evidence of the walls Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls When we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it more  I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time  
I didnt trust my wife when I found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling I investigated him before I found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on Now all my wife and I do is fight about trust, Hello Being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled Has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her If so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back Couples counseling would be of benefit If not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved In the meantime I suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak Ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her Instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship Hope it all works out for you both

Im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend At the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tims heart He is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but I dont really believe him     Lately Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year Hes been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her But hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves He seems really torn up about it and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves     He knows that I still crush on him He doesnt rub it in my face Hes a good guy but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us How do I do that when the time comes How do I support him and show him that Im here without wanting to hook up How do I make him feel better He is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which I think is ridiculous, First off I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do Know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelingsnbspand understanding Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upIm not sure if that is possible If you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what Be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues Good luck to youbr

I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years Im having bad flashbacks Im scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams I dont leave the house because I have panic attacks, Im sorry for your suffering  There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening  Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program youll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life  Then you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend  Sending good wishes in your work 
Im in my early 20s Ive been married once and he cheated on me Ever since then Ive felt ugly no matter what Im engaged and I still feel ugly I dont like to take pictures of myself, Sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband  He did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling itbr  Does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident  You may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt nbspIt is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until now  As you address all the emotional pain youve lived through the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own Because youd be focused on you not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband

My husbands exwife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor He by his own admission is addicted to child pornography My stepdaughters are now all teenagers They do not know My husbands exwife has kept this information from my stepdaughters The stepfather has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently The exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented It is a constant strain on my husband knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography My own therapist believes the girls should be told The exwife says her therapist says the opposite, Lorain youre correct that your husbands exwife is seriously minimizing this problem I have a very strong opinion here In my book the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adultsnbsp  Of course the girls should be told because they have the right to know Their voice is not the only one Im concerned about here though I believe your husband has the right to insist that his daughters be in a safe home and there is clear evidence this man is not safenbsp  This woman is putting her own comfort she simply doesnt want to deal with her partners situation her own fears or anyone elses needs above the safety of two vulnerable girls Honestly if it was me my kids wouldnt be even visiting that home with that man present repented or not Its not worth the risk If she decides to stay with him the natural consequence of having a known perpetrator in your home is not having access to vulnerable children in that same home

Im feeling different towards my husband I feel I am growing from the relationship I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five I just dont feel that connection anymore I feel nothing I dont know why or if Im just being irrational, Lacey Im SO glad you wrote Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now Im glad youre paying attention to itnbsp  When you first meet someone there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection Then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years long enough to procreate and keep the human race going and then it wears off a bit and you end up looking at each other thinking how come I dont feel the same anymore  Mostly not always and Ill get to that in a minute all that this means is youve stopped doing all those loving things you used to do Its as though you filled the car with gas youve run out of gas now and youre forgetting to put more in  The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that youve cut back on Act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings Talk to your partner about this Its okay to say do you remember we used to do XY and Z Can we do that again Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me Ask for what you want instead of complaining What are your love languages What are your partnersnbsp  Marriages need to be fed Its that simple Many things get in the waychildren jobs but mostly complacency Get active with your love  Okay now you might read this and think thats not whats happening Thats a cue to talk to someone like a therapist about your feelings People do grow and change and sometimes relationships dont fit anymore But these are huge decisions not to be made lightlynbsp  I wish you happiness

I decided to stay and work it out I just dont want to sit on the couch Other than that I have been getting over the situation I dont feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and wont leave me alone about it I can move on and continue to love laugh and play with my wife I just dont want to sit on that couch, Houston Its normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger so I get why you dont want to sit on it but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive Am I to assume that you cant afford a new one Ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forwardnbsp  t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gonenbsp 
My toddler defies everything I say and doesnt see me as authoritative so she says no about everything Id like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time, Hi Biddeford  This is a super goal Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to theres a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world Of course your toddler defies you and thats healthy I worry more about the overly compliant ones She is wanting to know what the rules are and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are Ill give you some tips  First remind yourself that its her job to learn what the rules are and where her power is Dont be so surprised when she wants it her way If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own were less caught off guard when it happensnbsp  Avoid situations that invite power struggles Any time you tell your daughter do this now you set up a power struggle The good thing is that shes young enough you can pick her up now is the time to teach her that moms or dads word means something So if you say lets get you dressed then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen you can make it happen And Im talking about gently picking her up herenot roughly Pick your battles only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen  Give her choices so she can see her power Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear give her two choices Heres an exampleshes on the ipad and you say ipad time is over She says no You can say ipad time is over If you put it down you can play later If I have to take it away you dont play it later The choice is hers Then follow through  Whenthen statements are really helpful Your child asks for something Instead of saying no try as soon as the toys are picked up we can have a snack Youre simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they dobut they have to earn itnbsp  Staying calm yourself is the key because then at least you will feel in control of yourself which is the ultimate goal Use selftalk to calm yourself Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted and it will be over by the time the breath is done You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions Time is a useful tool not enough parents use Good luck  br 
My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now Throughout the entire first day that we met he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another That same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed The next two days were a repetition of the first day On the third night my mother finally caught us and I was kicked out of my house I left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple It was very hard for us His stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot Our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month After that it was a downward spiral We were constantly arguing about money food and our families We kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument After six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started One afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one He told me to let him leave or he would hit me He had once promised he would never touch me so I challenged him to do it He slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me I havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now I dont live with him I dont depend on him and we dont have children We both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly He always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I dont ever make the effort to try to be okay Ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me I know he has to change that on his own I just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned Is there hope for a better future together, Hi Winters I learned a long time ago that I cant ever predict who will change and who wont I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change But in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind Youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change Only you can decide how many years to give it I see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though What are you waiting for  Although you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change It doesnt work that way Just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work You can only decide when youve paid too muchnbsp  I bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you Hes not your only supportnbsp 
My girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because I said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers I have been trying to get her back but it isnt easy She is in her 50s and I am in my 40s She is the one I want for my life and this is killing me Every day I cry and I am desperate for help, New York what would it mean about you if you got her back Is that the only way you can like or forgive yourselfif she forgives you and takes you back Your self respect doesnt need to rely on this working with her She simply doesnt want to be with you and every day that you refuse to honour her decision is another day that you hurt her all over again Move on and heal perhaps with the help of a therapist 
Im a teenager My entire family needs family therapy and more than likely individual therapy My parents refuse to take action and Im tired of it Is there any way I can get out of this myself,This sounds like a really tough situationnbsp As a teenager you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstancesnbsp If your parents are refusing tonbspconsider counseling you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adultnbspabout finding some counseling resources  even without your parents helpnbspnbspbr
After a domestic abuse situation I went to a therapist and then my husband went The therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me She then told my abuser the results of my tests, It sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permissionnbsp There are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality howevernbsp For example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that person  If you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory boardnbsp The boardnbspwill then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate actionbr

My toddler defies everything I say and doesnt see me as authoritative so she says no about everything Id like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time, Thats a good question I would say learn to pick your battles What types of behaviorsituations can you let go of If you allow yourself to worry about the various areas in life that you cannot control you will find yourself stressed out and unable to manage everythingnbspKnow that toddlerhood comes with lots of nos tantrums noncompliance and a growing need fornbspindependence When your toddler does something that you dont approve of remain calm explain to himher the appropriate way to act and model it for himher Remember to give your toddler praise when heshe does something good or acceptable Be consistent and follow through with your instructions Finally know that you are not alone Parenting comes with its set of challenges but all you can do is your very best Good luck to youbr 
I love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration I hate it I dont know why but I just want it to be over I feel like crying I dont know why I dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it, Does your boyfriend notice that you hate sex  If yes then it is a topic which the two of you would gain deeper understanding of each other by discussing  If no then possibly one reason for hating sex is that your boyfriend doesnt notice who you are as a person not simply a physical body engaged in sex 
Why am I so afraid of it I dont understand, Your fear is somewhat reasonable nbspNo one wants to be raped and I imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel like  Do you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would like  If this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fear  Is it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped nbsp  One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe nbspThe more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decrease  The other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physically  In families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generation  Its possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own suffering  The good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden 
I have no idea what happened I go places and do things but still feel lonely I honestly have no friends and I am always the one texting people and bothering people I feel invisible like someone that no one wants to be around, A lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situations  Is it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your life  If yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choice  At the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you first  Also most relationships are not forever nbsp  Is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity  br 
My toddler defies everything I say and doesnt see me as authoritative so she says no about everything Id like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time, Trust that you are a good mother and that you love your child  Trust and love are their own authority and come from a different inner place than the urge to be obeyed  Trust and love are effective guidance and usually feel happier and lighter too

Over the course of a few days my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues After she thought things through she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me She instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family At that point she said our marriage was over Now over the course of the last few days she has taken a friendship from a coworker She insists there is nothing more than friends but she has spent all her free time with him, Hi Portland  This must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend I get how upsetting this is  If I was your therapist Id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening Be careful not to jump to conclusionsnbsp  Sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage She may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said sonbsp  Its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it Only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but its not your place to tell her to do thisnbsp  Or its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her nbsp  Right now its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate if shes asking for that We cant trap people in a marriage If she needs separation or distance then its respectful to give her that  That doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want whether its to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of timenbsp  I cant predict what will happen here But you can find out what the best path for you is I wish you the best 
My daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years She doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse The visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy, Hi Dillon  Im from Canada so I dont know the laws in your state It depends on that a good deal perhapsnbsp  In my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent then this should be honourednbsp  Unfortunately the laws dont always uphold a parents right to do what is best for their child I recommend you see a lawyer who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements  If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy that is a separate question Or is she already in therapy A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child It isnt always appropriatenbsp 
My partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process Its especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him I feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me, Hold on Sanger You know I meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes they wonder if its best to go back I dont think so  If your ex is using the children to manipulate or is generally controlling the separation process thats confirmation that getting out was the right decision  Your partner feels powerless to change the current situation Of course he does because there are many things that are beyond his control his exs behaviours for one Accept the powerlessness Lean into it Its okay because there are many things he does have power over and thats where he can focusnbsp  He has the power to give his children a happy dad Thats HUGE Thats why he left Id guess I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels Thats his exs voicethats what she wants him to feelto give into that is letting her win Ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right He has not intentionally harmed his children Hopefully hes aware that the separation has nbspaffected them and hes working to create peace and balance in their lives but hes can let go of the shame she wants him to feel its crippling him  He has the power to separate emotionally from his ex Hes not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions Hes still reacting to her He hasnt completely left yet  A good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions combat shame create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries He needs your support in moving forwards not going backwards I wish you the bestnbsp 
Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting I say mean things to let my anger out Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful I hurt the ones I love with my words I want to be better for myself and them, Congratulations on making your way to Step One selfobservation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others  There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible  Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind nbspOnce youre able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people youd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind they are  For example if you expect others to always be accepting tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend and youre hearing otherwise from people then you can prepare yourself for possible less than positive comments about your relationship or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all  Basically the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views the easier and calmer time youll have in handling comments from others that youre not glad hearing  Also this is a long process because youd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting  Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process youre placing yourself 
I have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater, Sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painful  Everyone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by living  All of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of others  The best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationships  If you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of origin  This realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situations  This type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parents  Expect slow progress and expect more than a few tears  If it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourself  Sending lots of good luck 
My boyfriend recently got a kitty I hate cats in general and he knows it It grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat I want to throw out the cat I feel very jealous, Sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense position  What was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with you  If you dont already know his answer then find out nbsp  Doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you nbspDoes he expect you to accept without question whatever he does nbspDoes he care about your views nbspDoes a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you so  Please dont be mean to the cat nbspIts not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends care  There are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriend  Who knows your boyfriend may come back home with three more cats  Start with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings 
My daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years She doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse The visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy, Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitation  Or is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughter  If no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then I dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing her  If your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or not  The one move Id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated 
Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting I say mean things to let my anger out Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful I hurt the ones I love with my words I want to be better for myself and them, Hi California  Im happy to hear you want to get a hold of this problem Relationships dont tend to last when we treat people poorly It is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort I would highly suggest working with a therapist and I will give you a few things to think about in the interim  Sometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair but many times anger is a secondary emotion and its simply there to protect us from other more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid Discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important Perhaps you feel powerless or unloved or unimportant It may take some time before you recognise this emotionnbsp  Once you do you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion Where did it originate At what age did you feel too much of that feelingso much so that you cant stand it even in tiny amounts  You will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling They are typically incorrect thoughts like No one lifes me or People will always hurt me Fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that arent likely  Your habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of selfworth and you dont believe people will love youso you hurt them to keep them at a distance This happens in a subconscious level Do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didnt believe in your worth So its backwards really because you think youre getting mad at people who piss you off but youre really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourself  In addition to this work you can start to purposely treat people more kindly Find out what respect is make amends and nbspresolve to spreading peace It might sound too simple but if you act as though youre a person of peace you will start to feel more peaceful  But I hope you do contact a therapist It will take time and support to reach your goal 
My son stole my debit card and lied about it Its not the first time he has lied I dont know what to do anymore I dont know if I should punish him or make him do something Ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong I have grounded him but nothing works What should I do, Hi Enid You sound like a sensitive parent I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong There is some key information here I dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but Ill give you my thoughts  I see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world In order to accomplish that many of them test limits What can I get away with is a question they have to find the answer to If a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits So part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying Not all kids steal but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point Its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find outnbsp  Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and Im not surprised he lied about it If you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it Its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible The behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good ideanbsp  Its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes Its a dilemma If you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day That gives him incentive to come to you with truth It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truthnbsp  You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty Put a cookie on the counter Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day Then ask them later if they took the cookie Youre making honesty fun Kids love gamesnbsp  Basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negativenbsp  If this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns If its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapistnbsp 
I was hanging out with my close guy friend We started kissing but afterwards he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything We both just got out of relationships His was very sexual Im not a sexual person and he knows that I want to be with him but Im not ready for another relationship and I dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends, Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction  Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energynbsp  Stay focused on what you know about yourself which is that youre not ready for another relationship  From what you describe about your friend similar to you he does not feel ready for a new relationship  If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive then youll be in a position to find out either by approaching your friend as a potential partner or by asking your question of his interest in you  Who knows  It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship approach you and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become accept his offer  Good luck with Step One becoming familiar with your new state of single hood and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship 
Its been almost a year since my exboyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times I had found out about a month before but I hadnt told him I knew because I didnt want us to break up I used to have very low selfesteem and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic My father cheated on my mother when I was little I wonder if this pain has to do with that My exboyfriend and I were only dating for five months but I still cant get over this betrayal Im not sure what to feel to get over it forgiveness Hate He helped me financially after our break up by lending me 3000 so Im grateful for that I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although were not even talking anymore We follow each other on Instagram and thats it I feel like I still need his validation This is haunting me day and night I want to focus on my new relationship and goals but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my exboyfriends Instagram and Facebook I feel so bad and keep having nightmares, The dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationship  Continue developing some points youve written here  That you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship life  This is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us nbspWhat we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal no matter how bad it actually is  After all children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do is wrong compared with the rest of our culture  It is natural to long for a relationship  What you have the chance to do now is distinguish the reasons for your longing  Is it to attach to someone who has hurt you hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you and whose validation even if he says validating words has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm us  If youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime 
I just had a newborn When I brought him home my mom told me to leave Now Im in a womens home I dont see my boyfriend that often because he works The womens place is helping me find an apartment so I can go back to work and get child care, Congrats on the birth of your son  Was your moms request for you to leave her house one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the door  My question is whether your mom had some changed circumstance in her life whether she and you discussed living arrangements prior to your sons birth or whether nothing was talked about you assumed youd be living with her she assumed you wouldnt and the two of you didnt speak to one another about any of this  Depending on the answers there may be clues as to handling future expectations of others especially your mom  From what you write the womens home is supportive of your basic daily living needs nbsp It is good news that the people who run this home know and offer community resources  In your interactions with the staff of the womens home ask all the questions necessary so youll have a clear understanding of the apartment lease anything at all that is on your mind about becoming employed and finding childcare  The point is to have all the major steps youre about to start addressed  This way youll be minimizing the possibility of any sudden bad news by the womens home told to you  Sending lots of good luck 
I have been married for 20 years He and I both cheated I hid my cheating for 14 years Over that time I let life stress me out I became depressed When I finally woke up he felt I had pushed him out, Do you both want to fix the marriage  The relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too will have one person who does all the changing  br  This dynamic itself creates problems of its own  About your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like this  All you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt like  If he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you is ok  Because affairs create mistrust between two people the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trust  Talking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other how you each are feeling what matters to you is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future 
My exboyfriend boyfriend and I lived together He had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her One was an abortion another was a miscarriage and then she had the third baby They are not together but he continues to contact me and wants me back He has nothing to offer me, Hi Attica  This is a question I think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for themnbsp  In your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you For some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you If you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries Dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour Remind yourself why you dont want to be with them I hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me Thats great selftalk  But lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this Sometimes its because we still hope they will change Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days The problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less So what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of People do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to changenbsp  Another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life This is a normal but not a healthy thought Its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes You deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardynbsp  It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused If you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better It will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behaviours  Draw a line Their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importancenbsp  br  br 
I was never like this Recently this year my first year of high school I started getting emotional for no reason, Hello Vancouver Its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes The small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling Youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke If theres anger there look underneath that Is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame nbspThen ask yourself when in your life youve experienced TOO much of that feeling As a child maybe but not necessarilynbsp  Thats the first step and combined with empathy compassion and selfesteem youre starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner A good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily I wish you the bestnbsp 
I have a really bad temper I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day I dont mean to be that way but I cant help it, A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves nbspnbsp  A surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday and when that particular Tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furious  The fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it  If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly  Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone eventually the person possibly you learned to contain and contain your emotions  It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history to not talk about  As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear nbspare really the underlying source of your upset  I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions 
About a month ago I went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me He gave her a promise ring when they were together and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room I found many things on his phone but that broke my heart the most He deleted all the messages but two I cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that It really kills me and I cant stop thinking about it, Your sense of hurt is very understandable  Do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phones  I ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship  Probably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the other  With this new level of clarity his nbsppast relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful   Once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little 
I noticed lately that Ive been thinking a lot about death I dont want to die and Im not suicidal I just think about what would happen if I died or if someone I loved died I imagine how sad everyone I know would be I know it isnt worth it and I definitely want to live and have a future I just think about it When Im driving I sometimes imagine what would happen if I just let go of the wheel and kept going, Ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving youll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least nbspnbsp  It is fine to play in your mind with what ifs nbsp People who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions  If you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on death  Since you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in you  Play around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their lives  This may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others 
Ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder Lately Ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago All of a sudden I dont feel as comfortable around him as I used to although I cant seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way, Hi New Jersey  You talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together Thats a lot  I love how you recognise that you been questioning everything I think anxietys got its toe in the door and its pushing you around wanting some power over you Fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that its best to either pull away or fight But letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isnt the answer here I think you know that already  You must have moved in with him for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in Fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision You can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriend  When youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change I suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear 
My husband and I have been together for seven years now I will be honest I have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff I recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because I was afraid to tell him what happened Ever since then he gives me the cold shoulder He gets so mad and ignores me for days Hes really verbally and emotionally abusive He tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names Should we call it quits Im tired of crying but we have a toddler together, Hi Texas Thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask Should we call it quits We I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours togethernbsp  span stylelineheight 142857The way your husband treats you is not your fault Texas Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you The problem is not your lying The problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trustspan  span stylelineheight 142857Theres an analogy that I sometimes use I dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but its powerful either way so I will tell it to youspanbr  If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die If you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying it has lost its strengthnbsp  Its called learned helplessness When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to younbsp  You have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child In my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abusenbsp  This is a complex picture and if you were my client I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your childnbsp  I sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist I wish you the best  br  br 
Im depressed I have been for years I hide it from everyone because Im scared of the reactions Ill get Last time I tried telling my parents it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed Im a legal adult calling me ungrateful and telling me that if I cant handle things now its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true Its exhausting pretending to be okay and I dont know how much longer I can try Im just really tired and sadly I cant afford the help I need on my own, Hi Georgia Theres a really good lesson here People tell us things and we tend to think thats the truthbut its not Ill do some translating for you  Youre so ungrateful means I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel Im a good parent  Youre too young to be depressed means I dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now Ill pretend its not happening so I dont have to face my fear and shame  Its only going to get worse just means I dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sake  Your parents are being unsupportive not because youre not suffering but because this is all theyre capable of right now They are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places Its out there If might be an aunt or a friend or a friends aunt It might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor Keep looking for someone who will hear you I hope you dont ever give up   br 
I was texting a guy who wasnt my boyfriend and my boyfriend found out We work together so he went to work and told everyone I was cheating on him I moved out of the house There have been previous problems and I feel like Im usually the issue here In order for us to move on he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesnt want me to do anymore Im wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if I should walk away, Hi Dallasnbsp  While I think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid Will you have a list too There are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out Your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship Do you have a voice If you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice If you cant hear your own voice maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and want  No relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy Relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do They dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor You have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you Youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly A therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is 
I am on my own with my daughter I am so worried and stressed about her, Your instinct to help your daughter is natural  How you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing her  Also her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describe  If you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit her  If your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselor  Starting therapy without willingness to do so is risky nbspThe person may feel resentful enough to not participate nbsp And sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapy  Family counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situations  Also if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response  br 
I dont know how to have emotions I never had any from my birth Being human I think of myself as a monster I enjoy pain I cut myself for my climax during sex I think most of the time I lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth I was in rehabilitation for four year I have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions The books that I enjoy reading HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe I go hunting every Saturday I feel powerful I dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,divIm not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotionsnbspdivdivbrdivdivFrom what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel nbspLittle kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth nbspThis is information someone told you or was part of your family systemdivdivPossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yoursdivdivbrdivdivSimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection nbspBesides monsters are an idea they arent real nbspThey embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species nbspAgain I wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you aredivdivbrdivdivA way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongdivdivIf on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsdivdivbrdivdivIf someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel nbspKeep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotionsdivdivbrdiv
Ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder Lately Ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship My boyfriend and I just moved in a few months ago All of a sudden I dont feel as comfortable around him as I used to although I cant seem to find a reason as to why I feel this way, How is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around him  Has he told you that hes noticed changes in you  The good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person nbspDoing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship nbsp  Given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise nbspIt just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of you  Psychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills nbspVery often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually are  Anxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressed  It is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters nbspnbsp  Be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you nbsp Youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations nbsp  Keep the label of being disordered aside nbspPsychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives  br  br 
My motherinlaw is mentally ill She has been for most of her life She cuts herself She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself She has had multiple shock therapy treatments and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant Her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late 30s She doesnt even have custody of herself She hasnt asked yet but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child How do I go about saying no without creating an issue, Hi Fontana  Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question It seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response I like your healthy boundaries and Ill help you explore possible ways to respond to hernbsp  First she hasnt asked yet and you dont know that she will Right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints Theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them theyre more likely to go away You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations So the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry You might never have to face that moment But I understand that you want to be prepared  As her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come Is he willing to do this But if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later No need to apologize or hum and haw  We love that you want to be around Junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here Youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your own  If she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries Id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue Really theres nothing to discuss Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life I wish you the best 
I have known her for years She was dating my brotherinlaw when we met My kids think of her as their aunt On Halloween 2014 I lost my mom to cancer My mom and dad were still married when she passed away My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis She has been a very big part of both me and my kids life but now last month my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her Shes like a sister to me My kids hate the idea, How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wishbr  Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you wantbr  Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend is reasonable  Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint and also ask him for his impression of your feelings  Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasnt yet told you  It is also possible that a conversation on the subject as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend may develop in a very positive way  Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel  Given that the person who died was your mom maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spousenbsp  Try to see the situation from the point of everyone including yourself who is involved in this major change nbspMaybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad would open new empathy for all of these family members  br 
My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives We are pretty transparent and honest and basically she feels bad because she never wants to have sex She doesnt have the desire Shes also never orgasmed She feels like a terrible wife and fears Ill cheat on her She doesnt know why Last time we had sex she cried and felt bad and didnt know why she cried However she also told me that the last time we had sex she felt me in her but it just felt ehh and wanted to stop That makes me feel really awful We rarely have foreplay Everything I try tickles her so she makes me stop We are both frustrated but very much in love She and I are in our early 20s Were married and we have a baby on the way, Congrats on your upcoming baby  Its possible that the pregnancy is diminishing your wifes sex drive  From everything you describe about your wife she sounds to not yet have become comfortable with having a wish for sex  The other side of the sex equation is you and your relative ease with having sex and whether it is for physical release or as an expression of love some of each  Since you talk with each other honestly then start with a dialogue about what you each would like from sex with each other from perspective of giving and receiving sex nbspHopefully this will open up some new light on your respective feelings  Really there is a lot to navigate in a conversation about physical and emotional intimacy nbsp  If these are not the types of discussions the two of you are used to having a couples therapist is a good idea so you both become familiar and learn how to more easily articulate some of your respective deep feelings  br

Im in my late 50s I never loved or have been loved I need deeper help than is offered in my small town but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia I find myself losing hope more and more My brain barely works anymore and my memory so small I forget in a moment I serve no purpose Im incapable of work or anything of value and I never have been Im a complete waste of time and resources and yet I keep trying Why Why does God insist that I continue to exist Im not suicidal just tired, Hi Oak Harbor  My heart goes out to you Sometimes when Im working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety I ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds What are the worst thoughts that run through your head Often they struggle perhaps out of shame maybe they dont want me to know their worst thoughts But I can help them better if I do know because then we have a place to work from You are feeling hopeless and worthless and your thoughts support these intense emotionsnbsp  I dont know you but I strongly believe that you have someone in your life who if they heard your thoughts would say Thats not true I know where her value is I believe that there are people who would see your value clearly even if in small things Can you imagine those voices  You mentioned God so lets invite God into the conversation What might God say to you What evidence might Godwho sees allhave of your worth What hint might God give you about your purposenbsp  You suffer from severe anxiety and the agoraphobia works together with fear theyre a tag team Fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you or something equally bad and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth Do you see their plan Make her scared keep her here aloneconvince her its hopeless They both try to convince you that they are your only friends except theyre lying to you They only want power over you  You forget your worth You forget that we all have worth No one is a waste I believe all Gods creatures have worth and that were here to use our gifts to improve the world and to remind each other of our value There are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs Can you find them My guess is youve been alone and isolated for a very long time and its impossible for you to see your worth in this situation We need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors We see our value in their eyesnbsp  Do you remember the first time you questioned your worth What was happening that you blamed yourself for Can you speak to that child and tell her or him that whatevers happening isnt her fault Its that child who cannot see her own worth probably because someone treated her as though she had none Thats only a story though not the truth Can you find another thread of a story Who might tell a story of your worth  Oak Harbor I believe that there is help closer than you think Fear wants you to believe its hopeless You reached out herecan you reach out again Start with just one person and that will lead you to somewhere We dont know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone Youve stopped living You can choose any moment to startnbsp  I wish you peace and hope   br 
I have known her for years She was dating my brotherinlaw when we met My kids think of her as their aunt On Halloween 2014 I lost my mom to cancer My mom and dad were still married when she passed away My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis She has been a very big part of both me and my kids life but now last month my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her Shes like a sister to me My kids hate the idea, Hi Lincoln  It can be very difficult for children who have lost a parent to then see their other parent moving forward with anyone so I understand how this change is even more upsetting to younbsp  Andyour father and your friend have clearly established a friendship and fallen in love Did you see this coming I hope they didnt hide it from you If they did maybe this is the issue It would be a legitimate one  But in the end your father and your friend are adults who are free to fall in love with whomever they wish and hopefully they can count on the support of people who trust and love them Could there be blessings here you havent seen yet It seems you love this person who is like a sister could it be a good thing that her place in your life is more permanent  Ask yourself these questions What is the worst part of this What do I fear losing What do I fear at all What is the evidence that this will happen The answers might surprise younbsp  Your children will follow your lead If you are supportive of their grandfather they will follow suitnbsp  Hopefully you can grieve the change know that your mother would likely want both of them to be happy and embrace the blessings that come with having this woman close to you in a new way I wish you the best  br  br  br  br 
My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives We are pretty transparent and honest and basically she feels bad because she never wants to have sex She doesnt have the desire Shes also never orgasmed She feels like a terrible wife and fears Ill cheat on her She doesnt know why Last time we had sex she cried and felt bad and didnt know why she cried However she also told me that the last time we had sex she felt me in her but it just felt ehh and wanted to stop That makes me feel really awful We rarely have foreplay Everything I try tickles her so she makes me stop We are both frustrated but very much in love She and I are in our early 20s Were married and we have a baby on the way, Hi Seattle  While its normal in many relationships for there to be a difference in sex drives I believe that your wife has a major barrier to having a healthy sexual relationship Id be curious about what it was like at the beginning for you both but these things can change Sometimes people with sexual barriers are very active for a period when theyre young because theyre trying to prove something or overcome a fearnbsp  Right now you can both accept that there is a barrier and its hers and she can explore that in a safe relationship with a therapist and perhaps a doctor Its possible shes asexual not interested in sexual activity but very interested in love or that a trauma has affected her Its for her to explore Tell yourself that its not your fault stop expecting it to change and encourage her to seek treatment with someone who specializes in sexual issues Good luck 
My boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me and I believe it It has been one of the best relationships I have been in for a short period of time but he has lied to me so much Hell tell me that hell stop lying and while hes saying that hes hiding something or lying about something First it was about a girl He hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in Next was his exgirlfriend He put a fake contact name and it was just friendly but he lied to my face All the time he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better, New York New Yorkits not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself Verbal expressions are easy but its walking the walk thats more important in the end When someone shows you what theyre capable of you can believe them Hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lyingnbsp  What youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence He might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behavioursnbsp  My wish is that you start by believing in what you deservenbsp 
We got into arguments and we would break if off but start it back up again We clicked or so I thought We are both married with problems in our marriage We never have sex we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together His wife found out and he lied to her and didnt even refer to it as an affair I cant stop thinking about him We just click Ive been married for 16 years and Ive never liked anyone other than my husband Now I like him and well never be together, If you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved There is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage Maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life nbspIf you and your husband are willing I would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together nbsp  You may enjoy this article to learn a little more about some factors that lead to connection or disconnection and that a hrefhttpwwwcoupletherapytorontocomtherapycounsellingpsychotherapyresourcesarticlesthesesimpleinteractionspredictlastingloveorseparationanddivorcepredict separation and divorcea

Im a young adult woman and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts At the time I was pretty religious but I let this happen I dont know why I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldnt like it My parents are very religioustheyre Christians We did things every time hed come over to my house We didnt have anything to do at our house so we would get tempted to do things when wed watch movies by ourselves    One day my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages As soon as my dad found this out he told my mom They were both aggravated They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants They said he wanted me for sex and hes not a Christian I took their advice and broke up with him Once we broke up for about a month I decided to get back together with him a little after school started My parents found out eventually and I decided to not listen this time I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me and God totally forbids him I would kind of try to break up with him and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents Theyre always yelling at me about how I shouldnt date this boy I felt too old to listen to them Now Im kind of just stuck Is the real me religious Have I been brainwashed by him I dont talk to my parents anymore about him and my parents think Im deceiving because of it They threatened me that if Im still with him I cant do track and they wont support me Theyve also called me slut and now they called me basically a devil worshipper They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents Im actually very happy with him They also say Im living a separate life at home than I am at school They say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me, What a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you I would say the first thing you want to do isnbspif you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and lettingnbspthem know what you need from them If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward You unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from thenbsprelationship you have with your parents It always helps to try and see things from another angle You might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset Validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively   Are you living with your parents and do they support you If so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follownbsptheir rules Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshippernbspNot everyone will always approve of the choicesnbspwe make and sometimes we need to be okay with that Best of luck to youbr

How can I know if Im just being paranoid, Hi Texas  Oh thats a powerful idea isnt it It burrows into your head Lets figure this out First has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them Have they cheated before If not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence If its a yes then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that youre hiding something I need openness If they havent cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on What is the specific thing thats triggering your fears When you have your data recorded read on  The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting This may be true if what you wrote down is They didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence Im just scared and suspicious Thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened I can trust  If what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions Trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something Ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptions  The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating Maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw Id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on If this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around younbsp  I hope that helpsnbsp 
I am divorced and happily remarried Our blended family of children are in their 20s My youngest age 20 continues to call me crazy and favors her dad He was abusive to me and I left with injuries He never wanted kids and I did He paid child support only through forced wage earners Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom I dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core Im not sure how to handle this, It sounds really difficult to know that your daughter may be choosing her dad over you perhaps I can help by saying her intense emotional reactions towards you actually acknowledge how much safer and connected she feels towards you We tend to have big emotions around those we care for most I would suggest to let her know how hard it is to hear that and sad it make you feel at times and that this is hard for everyone Expressing your feelings to here will allow her to express hers toonbsp  br

I have bipolar II disorder Im addicted to alcohol and weed and Im hopeless I keep drinking even though its harming myself and others, Anyone who wants to change their life path eventually will be successful in this nbsp  How to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain  The basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed nbspAlmost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around 18 months  Most often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their family  With no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outlet  So people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weed  Therapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis oriented  If youd like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do this  Once you have a stronger selfrespect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people nbspHarming oneself is the opposite of selfrespect  br  Also about your diagnosis it may not be true at all nbspthe US healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugs  See if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrong  This simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first place  Good luck 
My boyfriend is seeking therapy He is in his 40s and has some childhood issues He has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them, Probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kids  Dont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured nbspA relatively qualified therapist would never make this call  Psychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families nbspYou and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants children  Childhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emerge  If the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting  br

My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this A while back 3 years ago I asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed I caught him one night drinking behind my back I confronted him and he lied but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again Lately my husband has been drinking on and off but I noticed it was every single night I didnt like this For our New Years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption He was on boardno more drinking every night  The other night I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing It took a couple of days but tonight I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but I couldnt wait I asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and I cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking He slurred a bit and said no I asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no I went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch   Im not sure if Im overreacting or not I just feel like Im so honest with him about everything and I expect the same honesty He is a good husband in every other regard, Hi Los Angeles  So your husband is giving you mixed messages He says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent It sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partnernbsp  Your husbands lying is sending a message I get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it Underneath that maybe its I want to stop but Im ashamed that I cant and I dont want you to see my failures Ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash nbsp  How does his drinking affect you Thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing Youve mentioned snoring which I guess is a legitimate complaint If hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint When he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you All of these things are legitimate concerns and Id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship But the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questions  Theres a conversation that would be helpful here nbspIt sounds like Ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively Id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement Can we get the alcohol out of the house Is he willing to seek treatmentnbsp  Lay your expectations out really clearly I wont count your beers but I cant tolerate lying You have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage What does he need Does he let you know what isnt okay with him He might have trouble saying these thingsnbsp  The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage A qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each othernbsp 
I am divorced and happily remarried Our blended family of children are in their 20s My youngest age 20 continues to call me crazy and favors her dad He was abusive to me and I left with injuries He never wanted kids and I did He paid child support only through forced wage earners Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom I dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core Im not sure how to handle this, Hi Arkansasnbsp  Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation Your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you Its a form of woman abuse and child abuse Hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and hes not considering how its affecting the kids Ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent In some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless Its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy itnbsp  While you cant change his behaviours and I think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kidsnbsp  For your children you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up Hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you dont have to fall for this If you run around screaming hes lying it only makes you look more crazy Try to stay calm and dont put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is One day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask Trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you Children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent They see who their dad is already Id bet but they dont know how to cope with that If hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict Dont engage on his levelnbsp  Dont blame your children completely Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it They are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness Children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them You get the worst because they trust your love But you can still have boundaries Letting them abuse you isnt the answer but have compassion for their position This picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choices  Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are You dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices Hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful It may take a while you cant rush it but they will see you for who you are Your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked onnbsp  Id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded Good luck  br

Ive been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now I am a young adult and right now driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety I cant ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on I have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me I miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack My family offers little to no support They think its fake or all in my head It makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where Id rather never wake up anymore I am not selfharming I just feel meaningless This constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life I was such a happy person I want my life back I want to travel with my friends and family again but I dont know how Ive almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that Ill live with this anxiety forever, Not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itself  How about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problem  Are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger  Maybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacks  If no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time  Its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself  If no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their support  Be realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need  Thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone nbspEventually youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough timenbsp  Hopefully the others will be more responsive to you  If they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like

I met a guy a while ago and I cant stop thinking about him I feel like I love him but I dont think I know him What if he is not who I think he is I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend I dont know am I too obsessive Every time we talk though its like magic He makes me feel amazing but what if Im mistaken, Keller it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world You can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have Youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendshipnbsp  So what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him Fear of rejection Fear of something else If you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships I recommend a therapist to help you work through that I wish you well  
A girl and I were madly in love We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together She moved away for school and we attempted a long distance relationship We eventually broke up Its been a year now and I still havent lost my feelings for her I still love her the same way I did Ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else Its damaging me and my life, Hi Boise Im sorry that youve lost this love The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time Its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life Youve been grieving for longer than you were together Oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache Lets look at some possible blocks to moving forward  It could be that theres something unfinished for you Maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right Maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say Maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way If this is the case you have two choices right You can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go If you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond Maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk Use the next paragraph to help you decidenbsp  Do you know how she feels How did it end Did she end it Was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work Sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore Use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs If shes asked for distance you would do well to honour that  span stylelineheight 142857A key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck Write it down What bad thing can happen if you let it go Or If I move forward that will mean nbspKeep goingwhat would be the worst part of that nbspThis kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placespan  It is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future As in If this person doesnt love me then Im unlovable or No one will ever love me as much as she did So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future Can you find another way to reject that message Try saying these things to yourself ulliI know she loved me There is evidence of thatliliI was a good partner There is evidence of thatliliIts part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardI can do this and learn from itliliMany people like methats how I know Im lovableliliIts normal to feel sad Im grieving a lost loveliliI want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrorliliI know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the wayliliIf this person loved me others can too but not if Im clinging to some old memoryliuldivThese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you I wish you welldivdivbrdiv
I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present, Hi Chapel Hillnbsp  I like your goal research is telling us more and more that one of the most important keys to happiness is having healthy relationships If we feel successful in that area it can give us the confidence and hope to tackle anything life throws at us  There are personal barriers we all have to having healthy relationships its our stuff our baggage not a steam trunk rightyou have a cute little Gucci bagnbsp  You hint that people may have hurt you in the past Maybe fear says stay awayhold onto resentment or you will be hurt again Resentment or simply focusing on the past is certainly a barrier to improving any relationship Learning to forgive ourselves and others is so important And rememberforgiveness isnt about saying something was okay it only means It happened I cant change that and I dont want to carry it anger hurt resentment around anymore so I let it go  span stylecolor rgb0 0 0 fontfamily Open Sans Helvetica Neue Helvetica Arial sansserif fontsize 14px fontstyle normal fontvariant normal fontweight normal letterspacing normal lineheight 20px orphans auto textalign start textindent 0px texttransform none whitespace normal widows 1 wordspacing 0px webkittextstrokewidth 0px display inline important float none backgroundcolor rgb255 255 255span classAppleconvertedspacenbspspanspanOrsometimes fear tells us that people wont accept us this keeps us isolated for sure But really all fear wants is power over usnbspFear is a trickster It tells us that if we let go of the past we will be rejected or hurt It says Im trying to protect you but what it REALLYnbspwants is to paralyze and isolate us all so it can feel powerful Once you pull thenbspsheeps clothing off of fear you can see that it doesnt help you at all  Once you see where your personal barriers are and you start to refute those thoughts in your mind you can begin to build new ideas about yourself and other people that are based on compassion instead of fearnbsp ulliEveryone deserves forgiveness and compassionliliNo one deserves to be judged by their worst momentsliliIf I look in the rearview mirror I cant move forwardliliWe are all beautifully imperfectliliI cant change the past but I have the power to make the future goodliuldivI wish you the best on your journeydiv br 
My fianc and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed I get less attention and little to no intercourse He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me We live two hours from family and when I leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone But when were together everything is okay No fighting or anything I love this man but I just dont know what to do anymore, Hi Rockford While no relationship is perfect and its natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we dont have to smother each other with attention anymore your situation sounds like something differentnbsp  He has no time for me yet you dont fight HmmmIs it that you dont fight because you dont bring up whats bothering you Are you avoiding conflict Many people do What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away As an engaged couple now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real Or maybe you have spoken to him about it If so what happens Does he listen and help you understand him better Or does he avoid and reassure youor maybe dismiss you This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work togethernbsp  He says leave me alone Thats a pretty bold statement about what he wants He doesnt seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is and how close you want to be Plus I have to say those words sound more like what a closedoff fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to benbsp  Giving him the benefit of the doubt it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change But if this is true he needs to tell you that so you can understandnbsp  So I suggest that the fact that when youre together youre okay is perhaps not the best barometer for how youre doing as a couple Listen to your gut I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are This may get rockier before it gets better but until you face whats not working you wont know who you truly are as a couple nbsp  When youre engaged its a really cool time to see a therapist tooto get some conflict resolution skills down before youre a married couplenbsp 
They dont go away and I feel like Im going crazy Does that ever stop Can it be a symptom of medication, This can certainly be a side effect of some medications If the voices are so powerful that you can not sleep or they are constantly present you shouldnt wait any time but go and see your doctor straight away br 
I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present, Remember the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we dont know what will happen tomorrow so take the present as your guide That is all we can do so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each daynbsp The happiness is helping others to feel a bit better br 
Im in love with my friend who is also a girl I fell in love with her in a few months That was my first love We used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on Facebook I thought she had the same feelings for me but I was wrong I always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life But all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy Ive tried to be in relationship with guys but I cant be in love with them, It all depends how old you are and what a particular situation isnbsp You may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real This is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person Time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a LGBT group with meetings and discuss this with them I hope this is helpfulbr 
They dont go away and I feel like Im going crazy Does that ever stop Can it be a symptom of medication, Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are  if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problem  Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem youre having  Crazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not  Certainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself And youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problem  Crazy people usually dont do responsible behaviorsnbsp 
I need answers to my anger possessiveness and urges  I am angry all the time I push people away so much that I actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was I have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine I have these urges to hurt someone really bad I want to see them beg for me to stop hurting I want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices What is wrong with me, What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describe  br  Maybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to others  br  Since you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in return  This is true even with imagining doing harm to others  What are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting others  Besides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being 
I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present, Would you describe yourself as sensitive to your surroundings and emotions  If yes this may explain why letting go of past problems is itself a problem  The dynamic of living one day at a time and letting go of past problems is more imaginary and wishful than real  It is a popular notion of TV FB and media  Doing the letting go has nothing to do with what is actually possible to do  Problems are not let go they are resolved somehow  Living one day at a time isnt possible for anyone who has consciousness nbspNo one can really disconnect from reality every day on which they wake up  Instead of trying to do the impossible which is promoted online and in media allow yourself time to recognize what went into creating a problem in your life in the first place nbsp  Understanding problems leads to peacefulness and resolution nbspThen you will have more freedom to make new relationships  Also be patient with this process and yourself  If you have deep attachment to painful situations in your life then possibly now is your time for understanding what went wrong  This is a process which cannot be rushed if it is to be done well  If it is done thoroughly then you very naturally will bring new relationships into your life  And life will no longer feel so painful that you can only manage one day at a time without hurting nbspYou wont need to forget what happened yesterdaynbsp 
My fianc and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed I get less attention and little to no intercourse He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me We live two hours from family and when I leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone But when were together everything is okay No fighting or anything I love this man but I just dont know what to do anymore, Your situation sounds a little painful  Have you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fianc  Now is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feeling  Until the two of you open up what bothers you all you or anyone who talks to you about the situation can do is take guesses as to what is driving your finances behaviors  Also in the moment of when your fianc texts you words you find surprising or startling you can tell him this nbsp Maybe by being clear and truthful about how what he writes affects you then next time he will change what he tells you  And if he doesnt then you know that you explained yourself he had this information about you and that  he isnt that willing to consider what you told himnbsp  Really the best first step is to open up all the topics you wrote about here with him nbspThis way youll give each of you to discuss how to care about one another in a meaningful way 
My husband and I are in a terrible place Part of me wants to fix it but then Im caught up with not knowing how and not being able to communicate my feelings to him because he always feels Im blaming him Sometimes I am because the feelings of distrust are so strong I feel they must be coming from something hes doing but sometimes I know Im being irrational Still that doesnt stop the anxiety The other half of the time I just want to walk away but I feel like that will only be a temporary fix, You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship nbsp  This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of you  Has he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you is contributing to problems in the couple  Is he willing to understand what youre asking of him without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamed  Your feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood nbspHes not willing to listen to you so of course youre frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelings  Willingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way sometimes requires a couples therapists assistance  Ask your husband if hes willing to understand not judge you nbspBe willing yourself to do the same  If after trying and getting nowhere youll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapists  Warning not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy nbspAsk the therapist if theyve had specialized training in couples therapy  Otherwise having a referee type therapy session of what do you think what do you think isnt going to do anything except frustrate both of you further  Good luck 
My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up Weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work I dont know how to trust him now but I really want to make it work and it seems like he does too But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems, Hi Michigan  This is a common issue How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you I totally get that its hard and I believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone You can be stronger in the scarred placesnbsp  I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust It is definitely possible to rebuild it because anything is possible if both people want it enough  Your boyfriend came clean to youthis is pretty crucial He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret You can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file Work on that filethicken it up Having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help younbsp  Other things that span stylefontweight boldhespan can do to help you thicken that file because after all his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure treat you as though youre a priority avoid questionable contact with other women have open communication give you passwords to devices so there is transparency He can help you to understand where those behaviours came fromwhy he cheated in the first places although people arent always good with those why questions  You can focus on telling yourself that people change that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least youve decided to give him that chance and that you want to be a trusting person If you act like a trusting person you will likely feel more like one Dont go snooping dont interrogate him Its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared  This is a start for you A good therapist can be helpful too 
I have been married for ten years My husband is 29 years my senior We have a young daughter Ever since she was born my husband has shut down We have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me Ive told him how I feel for years and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy but I still have to literally beg for sex and affection My selfesteem is gone and I feel so alone He has stranded me He uses his passiveaggressive ways and ignores every comment I make He refuses to talk to me in detail, Hi Smyrna  Your husband is avoiding dealing with this problem I understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally too  From what you describe it seems that hespan stylefontstyle italic wants tospannbspbe there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue My hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you But I think he does have something to say  Your husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten yearsthat puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty Has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age Its span stylefontstyle italicpossiblespan that your husband is bewildered angry grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this He may feel like hes letting you down and hes scared it will get worse so hes sticking his head in the sand Of course that doesnt help does it  The worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame Eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apartnbsp  Its a bit of a conundrumhow to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities Maybe lower your expectations for a bit Your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared and that hes not rejecting youjust protecting himself  I would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like Sweetheart we both know that somethings not right here I think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better but can we agree that its not I need you to either talk to me about whats happening or please go see a doctor What I need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us Either of those things would show me that  In the end you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way If he does neither then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriagenbsp  I wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help Just a thoughtnbsp 
I am divorced and happily remarried Our blended family of children are in their 20s My youngest age 20 continues to call me crazy and favors her dad He was abusive to me and I left with injuries He never wanted kids and I did He paid child support only through forced wage earners Now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices I made for them the past 15 years as a single mom I dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core Im not sure how to handle this, Hi I understand what youre going through Your daughters favor him because he has done no wrong in their eyes Im guessing they lived with you Growing up I was the same way I favoured my dad thinking he has done no wrong He also abused my mother multiple times and that never came to mind kids like their other parent more mainly because they dont see them everyday and they usually buy them everything they want because all he does it pay child support by force and then spoil their kids to make them happy You seem like a great mom dont doubt yourselfnbsp 
I constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff Its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious I dont sleep because Im thinking about something I can get rid of I dont know why I do it I started years ago when I lived with my dad then I stopped when I moved in with my mom Years later it has started again, Since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parent  Play in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this nbspAre you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things nbspIm only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarily  Anxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives nbspSo pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years nbsp Possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parent  Basically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released 
The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring It makes me angry and I want to solve it myself, Probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring  If youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen  Basically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling them  Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next steps  I dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head  One path I dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someone  Your needs matter 
Im a teenage girl I dont know if Im straight bisexual or gay Ive been straight all my life but a sudden rush of questions have come over me and I dont know anymore, Hi Brentwood While our society tends to want to put us into categoriesslotswhen it comes to sexuality because this is nice and neat and convenientmany people find that they dont fit perfectly into one or the other All you have to do is exactly what youre doing be aware of yourself and allow yourself to explore these thoughts and emotions both alone and in connection with a safe partner The people who love you will continue to love you as you sort through this You can resist the temptation to please others by giving yourself a label We are attracted to and fall in love with peopleand we cant always predict what gender they might be I love how open you are to discovering yourself Keep on that track  
I have been dating my boyfriend for a month and we want a baby We dont work or drive and we havent talked to our parents What should we do, Hi Athens When a teenager wants to have a baby its usually for a specific and not healthy reason Do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship It doesnt work that way Do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply Babies dont give to us we give endlessly to them I urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally A relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this Youre only starting to get to know each other I wish you well and hope you talk to someonenbsp

My brother just broke up with his girlfriend While they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother Now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us How should we approach the situation Is she doing the right thing for her child, Hi Tampa I get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him Hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him Certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact In my book the more people loving a child the betternbsp  But ultimately she has the right to make these decisions To oppose her wont likely do any good You can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as wellnbsp

I got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years We both fell in love and have been together for eight months He left the house and filed for divorce He decided to tell her about our relationship and she is willing to forgive and work on things This shook him They have two kids together He decided to put the divorce on hold He left town for a month to get clarity on the situation and see a therapist, Hi Miami I feel your sadness you might have planned a future with your best friend We live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection I believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enoughnbsp  Your friend came face to face with what leaving the marriage meanthuge changes and many intense emotions He is wise to consider his choices carefully especially if you have children there is good reason to work at a relationship that is less than fulfilling Therapy can help  So you fell in love with a man who was in an unstable place Hes taking the steps to create some stability for himself and that leaves you on hold not knowing what his decision will be I love that you seem willing to give him the space he needs to figure it all out This decision is hisnbsp  For yourself you can accept that being best friends with a man might not be a wise thing Many marriages dont fair well when friendships like that exist You flirted with danger both of you You fell in love but he wasnt free really Im sure his love for you is real and powerful but its not a competition Its one man choosing his life path You can focus on thoughts like this ulliHe has the right to choose his lifeliliWe flirted with danger by being best friendsliliI know he does love me this is not a reflection on my worthliliI can feel really good about giving him patience and the space he needsliliI feel proud of his honestyliliI feel proud if hes willing to fight for his marriage lucky herlucky kidsliliAcknowledge and allow yourself to feel that sadness that grief Its realliul If you have told anyone about the affair seek the support of that trusted person and know you have to grieve this in silence because it was born in silence I wish you well and for the record Im proud of the maturity you show in this situation  
I think Im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says Im just fine I dont think so I think Im stressing everyone else out, Im glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you  Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself  Is the friend who says youre just fine very familiar with who you are  Friend is a broad category  She may not know you as fully as you know yourself  Basically it is possible to be fine and have some inner stress  Follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware 
I have been dating my exboyfriends cousin for a few years We have gotten pretty serious He wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex, Does your boyfriend agree with the other peoples opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesnt like hearing  br  Talk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering him  Once the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow 
Im almost never happy Half of the time I dont feel anything I find it easy to make myself feel nothing I know I push people away because its easier I just want answers Im sick of feeling this way Its ruining my relationships with people, Maybe you have depression  The name of your condition matters much less than the descriptions you wrote of how you feel  Since youve observed how you sometimes interact with people and realize you arent happy with the result youve a very solid starting point for reflecting on your deeper wishes in relating to others  Start with asking reasons of yourself about the puzzling aspects of how youre engaging with others  Theorizing as to why you feel that pushing people away is easier and easier than what  Googling the keywords of how you feel may open a starting point for ideas on knowing yourself and what you wish for

When I go to school I feel like everyone is judging me even my friends I get overwhelmed which these thoughts and sometimes cannot get out of what I call a deep hole of thoughts I barely go to any of our school dances because of all of the people Not even when I am completely alone do these thoughts go away I still feel like people can see me and are judging me, It sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone It sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you Many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate In therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationshipsbr 
I love him so much and I dont know what to do, Hi Savannah This is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner doesnt feel loved Theres a great book The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman He explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner You might feel that by going out to work and earn money youre being loving but if your partners main love language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home The five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch I recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better You may never be fluent but you can get better The most important part is to understand each other better and to know that theres nothing wrong with either of you youre just speaking different languages You can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved I bet he just needs you to speak his language nbsp 
He owns his own business Sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me We have a son together and I get to stay home with him He says I complain too much about what hes doing Weve been together a year and a half I got pregnant after being together for a month We moved in together when I had my son in July Everything was great and then he started the staying out He then started not spending time with either of us I just dont know if Im doing something wrong Weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before, Hi Oklahoma Listen to him when he says this is how he is Your boyfriends behaviours are about him not you At the start of a relationship its easy to be loving and attentive but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply With time people reveal who they are  For some reason he is giving himself permission to detach from you and your son This could be for several reasons he may be avoiding intimacy and connection he may be avoiding commitment he may fear he isnt enough or and there is evidence of this one he may have misogynist attitudes about male privilege that interfere with his ability to be the kind of supportive and respectful partner that you neednbsp  It seems that youve addressed this problem with him and told him what you need Good for you His response seems dismissive though and this isnt a good sign Any problem can be worked through if you have two people who care about respect and listen to each other It seems this basic foundation is missing here  I suggest a therapist might be able to help you sort out where to go from here I wish you the best  
Ive been going through a rough time lately I been into nothing but women Ive never thought about men until a week ago Im very upset and depressed about this Its not normal to me I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that Im not gay I get the same results each time and I feel disgust This is tough on me Im scared that I looked too many times I keep thinking about it and shake all the time, Hi Brookfield It can be unsettling when we feel something as fundamental as our sexual orientation shifting I like that youre honest enough with yourself to say Im struggling with this To accept that there is a question is a brave place to be Andit doesnt necessarily mean youre gay  Unfortunately we live in a culture that wants to put people in slotsmale or female straight or gaywe tend to not like those grey areas so much as a culture The truth is that if we grew up in a society where there wasnt this categorizationif we felt free to explore and grow sexually we might be surprised at who we are attracted to You dont have to put yourself in a slot Our sexual preferences are more fluid than we think and it can change over time  We also live in a culture where there is prejudice against homosexuality or differentness in general The wish to not be gay can be powerful Many people who are gay spend years believing they were heteroxualfighting against repressing nbspor ignoring their gay thoughts This is needless pain If you are gay there is no shame in that and you can still have a glorious life filled with love and passion  Having said all thatjust because you have thoughts about men or get turned on by gay porm doesnt mean youre gay Many heterosexual people have thoughts and fantasies about the same sex its arousing because its naughtywere curious about the forbidden or were just curious Becoming aroused by gay porn is normal for many heterosexual mennbsp  Sexual orientation isnt just about sex either A different gauge of who you are sexually can be found in your emotions towards men or women Are you drawn into emotional connections with men more than women Who do you feel the urge to explore and be close to  Exploring your sexuality through being open to different experiences can help too How does it feel to kiss a man to touch a man as compared with a womansometimes this feels like such a big and forbidden step that its a barrier to discovering ourselves We dont want to open that doornbsp  I wish you well as you do exactly what you are supposed to be doingexploring and discovering yourself Its an exciting journey and you might want to find a trusted person to talk more about this withnbsp

I dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger Thats really the only one i feel, Well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you have  What is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings nbspYour answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feel  Sometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they were  In some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind nbspBy knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelings  Also spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are nbsp  Often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child nbspThey have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression nbspBy having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating 
Im a little paranoid My mind does get the best of me One night I put chairs under all of my door knobs because I thought someone might break in I also think a lot which is probably the reason for the paranoia I cant stand loud noises like the sound of cars going by The grocery store is too noisy and I feel like people are looking at me, Paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid nbspThey believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threats  From what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extreme  Instead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniqueness  This way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendencies  If you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you are  One possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself nbspThey may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream nbsp  From what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia 
I love him so much and I dont know what to do, Does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love him  Ask him this so you will clearly know his definition of love 
My life is completely normal yet I feel empty inside I feel as if I already know why Im alive to reproduce and die, Are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty nbspStart with knowing the context of when you feel something other than empty  If there is no recent example then in your mind go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty nbspRecall what you liked about this time whether you were by yourself or with others what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptiness  How did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die nbsp  If this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living  Give yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests nbspIt is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life that are brand new to you and which connect to your true selfbr  This is one way of respecting your individuality which of itself may decrease your sense of emptiness 
He is verbally abusive When he gets mad he just yells at me At times I feel scared, Good for you on recognizing your own feelings nbsp  Often in an abusive relationship the person who is being abused starts doubting themselves and starts tolerating then accepting abuse  Marriage is based in love and feeling taken care of by the partner nbspFeeling scared is the opposite of this  If you feel ready tell him the way you feel and pay attention to how willing your husband is to being aware that he yells and that you feel scared  If he has no idea of what youre talking about doesnt want to understand what you feel then slowly take steps to understand within yourself whether or not tolerating your husbands behavior is acceptable to live with on an everyday basis  br  br

Something happened this summer that I cannot forgive myself for When I think about what happened I feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me, A lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences As an example as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk Then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward Experiences allow us to grow find a balance and what to do and what not to do in order to move forward On the positive side you now know the consequences as for your actions not to take the same course Forgiveness comes with time as you learn how to walk again 
People have been calling me names and I have had enough of it I cannot stand it anymore Im done I have told someone this and that is why I am writing this The thoughts are awful, Its sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on developing ways to cope and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiencesbr

I was in a situation with a guy Hes my brothers friend and kind of like a brother to me He invited me over to hang out and then came on to me I was instantly terrified to say no and I gave in I dont know whats wrong with me I cant figure out why Im afraid to say no This is giving me a lot of guilt and depression, Hi Tennessee There is nothing wrong with you There are many good reasons why you didnt say no You didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary You also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first You instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually You said it yourself you gave in He wore you down  Theres nothing wrong with you It wasnt your job to say no Women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges It was his job to get your consent first He pressured you into itnbsp  A good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more If you said no what might happen then What might that mean about you What are you avoiding feeling Unloved unwanted cold What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no That you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do That youre special or that sexuality is special Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault isnbsp  span stylelineheight 142857I love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and I urge a widespread conversation about what consent it Men and women of all ages could use more of this trainingnbspspanbr  br 
Sometimes I cant stop thinking about life after death I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven   When I think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good I feel overwhelmed I dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever Sometimes I just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety   Am I crazy I dont think these thoughts are normal, Hi California What youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common Through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety Ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well  Its natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us Our brains are complex wonderful things Fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it But what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily We often spend TOO MUCH time worrying about things that happened or might happen When these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem So while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can get  In general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us They will use anything they can as evidence to convince you For example That person looked at you funny Youre strange looking Well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with younbsp  For you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever What does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever What would the worst part be A therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear It might be that you have no span stylefontstyle italiccontrol spanover who you are or where you go It might be that you fear going to hell because youre span stylefontstyle italicbadspan Search for that deepest fear  I invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf Its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life Thats whats happening now I suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true The problem is how long youre holding it in your hand You could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem The trick is to get it back on that shelf  Right now youre using distraction to do this Youre trying to focus on other things around you but I think the glass is still in your hand Its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf nbspAnd the key is in your thoughts Once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear So as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you CAN control You CAN control the extent to which you let fear take you overnbsp  With a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas You can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts I wish you the best

We are the legal guardianship of our grandson He has been acting out and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year How are we to handle this, Hi Boone This depends a lot on his age and the situation The younger the child is in general the more I would see this as your decision not his A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solutionnbsp  Some questions Was the parent harmful to the child Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child How likely is it to be a positive experience Do you have any contact with the parent You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen nbsp  I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent Is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit There are many possible goals this child might have in mind This will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill Once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contact  Once you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense nbspThe older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselvesnbsp  There are other options than a facetoface He can write to his mom or dad text or emailnbsp  Its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort When a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves Whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents I wish him the best and Im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson Youre very special 
We had our first kid 15 years ago and sex has been nonexistent ever since It only happens every three or four months We have been to counseling and I have been told over and over again she will come around She hasnt and Im intimately lonely I think its time to move on but how do I do that without hurting my kids, Hi Pocahontas This is a painful situation When youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection When it dries up its a very lonely place Its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship Its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues pain issues nbspsexual dysfunction or is asexualnbsp  There is no one answer here Only you can decide what is right for you But let me ask some questions to help you explore next steps  Aside from the sex is your wife loving and supportive What are the other ways in which you feel loved Does your wife talk to you Does she communicate her needs and desires Does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex If your wife is generally a loving open partner you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal Whether she resolves this or not it can help you to cope with the rejection This is your wifes issue and the ball is in her court  In my opinion if couples therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist Let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship If you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotionsnbsp  Pressure to have sex might push her further away Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship One good way to make sure you get is to give and I mean give what she wants not sexnbsp  Its appropriate to say to her now I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually If this is all you want Im not sure I can do it If you want us to be more sexual I need you to address what gets in the way for you nbspGive her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are See if she does seek help to address an issue that is hersnbsp  Thenyou have a decision to make I encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sexnbsp  br

I selfharm and I stop for awhile Then when I see something sad or depressing I automatically want to selfharm, In a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction nbspAccording to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this nbspWhen a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better nbspIf a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior nbspAnother way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences nbsp  Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior nbsp Someone who is trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy andor Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with younbsp 
I feel insecure in my life I dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues I have had a drinking problem for a few years I feel the reason I drink is not just because I like to but because I have lately been on edge Ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that I have been watching for years Im paranoid about driving on main roads Im very jumpy at the slightest noises, Given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with nbspFirst and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research nbspspan stylelineheight 142857There are however ways to address this nbspspan  span stylelineheight 142857As for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model DBT which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation nbspMindfulness another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence nbspThere are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships nbspWell worth looking intospan  Seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist nbspThis is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away nbspThink of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound nbspThe same applies here nbspThink of it as first aid for the mindnbsp 
I avoid talking to him because he always makes me more upset I cant be honest with him about anything because he is always rude to me, Hi Troy I totally get this Its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him Your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open But thats not who your dad is Your dad is your dad and waiting for him to change wont really help Nothing you do can change your dad butthere are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with himnbsp  While your response of avoiding him is understandable I wonder what effect it has on your dad Its possible that hes feeling frustrated rejected and punished by your withdrawal You may think he knows that youre feeling hurt but he probably doesnt So this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude so your habit is to be silent then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated His frustration comes out as more rudeness which makes you want to withdraw more and the cycle starts all over again You cant change his part of the cycle but you can change yours  Are you willing to take a risk Can you be honest about how youre feeling Whats the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad You know why I avoid you I stay silent because when I talk to you say rude things So if you want me to talk I need to know you can listen I imagine it would come out differently because youre a few generations younger than me but put that into your own words  I dont know the level of your dads rudeness If he is abusive then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this I dont want to put you at any risk But if you dont worry your dad will hurt you maybe give honesty a try  My point is that as rude as your dad may be checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude Its powerfulyour silence Your dad cant read your mind and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with him  And if youre both open to it seeing a therapist together can be really helpful

I feel like I am internally screaming all the time Externally I am calm but I have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly I dont feel sad I dont cry a lot I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming It kind of feels like Im a caged animal,As far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes it would be hard to determine without more information It sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly Part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body Many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts emotional numbness difficulty expressing themselves and bodily tension caged animal In working with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedombr br 
As a child my parents injured my brother so they went to prison I was there when he had gotten hurt but I cant seem to remember I also cant remember being with them quite well Its a blur, Sorry to hear of having witnessed violence within your family when you were very young  Your blocked memories are a selfprotection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling destabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust are harmful  Already you are at the first step which is to know that memories exist about the disturbing events concerning your brother  Probably the best way of finding your way back to those times is by paying attention to all of who you are today  The more intently and with loving interest you are able to notice yourself you will be gradually dissolving the layers of protective thoughts about intimacy being unsafe  Basically you will be teaching yourself how to slowly trust yourself  Since trust is what was violated while you were young you will be developing a new model for trusting yourself and others  Then more of the memories of your painful and overwhelming times will make themselves available to you  They are simply waiting for you to be strong and trusting enough within yourself to tolerate them 
I have not had a friend since I was 19 I dont go anywhere and I have no job all because Im afraid of people,Individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety Often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want In group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one anotherbr br 
I feel insecure in my life I dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does I have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues I have had a drinking problem for a few years I feel the reason I drink is not just because I like to but because I have lately been on edge Ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that I have been watching for years Im paranoid about driving on main roads Im very jumpy at the slightest noises, Sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this time  Since a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to you  Your observation that she says one thing and behaves in a different way is meaningful  Bringing your point to her attention would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her viewpoint about you  Basically youd be expecting her to care about you and how she handles herself with this question may clarify what youre trying to find out  The good news about your relationship with alcohol is that you realize youre overdoing it  From what you write the emotional pain and helplessness you feel currently seem too much to know about all at once  One possibility is to accept your feelings of hurt and insecurity nbspThis is the first step of working with them nbsp If they start feeling overwhelming then maybe too you can distract yourself for a while from the intensity by engaging in an activity that is not selfharming  After all you are the most important person in your life so keep yourself safe and healthy 
My issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself My rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor It causes violent thoughts but I never act I stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent not me I dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment, Knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualities  Anger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into words  Try thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such times  Also if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations nbspnbsp  Even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memory  If this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express

I feel like I am internally screaming all the time Externally I am calm but I have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly I dont feel sad I dont cry a lot I feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming It kind of feels like Im a caged animal, It is hard to make a definite diagnosis however I would say nbspthat it could be and or a combination of depression stress PTSD etc nbspMore background information would have to be needed nbspOne thing I would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms nbspIf what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out nbspThat would not be good when they do nbspGet help before they do 
Weve been together almost three years We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me Its hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry How can this be resolved We have kids and I dont want a broken family because we cant communicate, Under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge So while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you In simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed You are both still trying to get very early needs metnbsp  The best advice I can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful And seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck point  Avraham Cohen PhD RCC CCC

I am a teenage girl Ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young The problem is that I dont remember anything about this dream I still know that its the same one and then I wake up in a panic and I cry really loud without knowing the reason Why do I see the same dream why can I not remember it and what should I do to remember it,There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that I know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves One thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you rememberbr br 
My mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though Im in my 20s She argues with me over stupid stuff, This is a common issue You grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance Im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your momnbsp  Ultimately you only have control over yourself so thats the place to start You can remind yourself that Moms behaviours dont mean that she doesnt trust you or love you its just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range If you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm The more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationshipnbsp  Take a look at the picture from her perspective She may feel overwhelmed with finances are you in college and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesnt know how to recruit help for I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks Take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores Can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance nbspOkay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef She wants help You want respect Lets talk about how you get both  I propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic MomI see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want Sell it as winwin Then you write down some things that end up forming a contractnbsp  span stylelineheight 142857The first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene Moms voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard This is a Mom says nothing about listnbspspanbr  The second part is about what Mom needs from you What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult Does she want you to contribute to rent Buy your own food Do your own laundry What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom How will these things be enforced What will happen if you dont follow through Write it all down so its really clear It has to all be mutually agreed upon  The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her You can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre 20 years old Listen to what she wants too Beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be more willing to help out AND I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less Go for the winwinnbsp  I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom   nbsp 
I get so much anxiety and I dont know why I feel like I cant do anything by myself because Im scared of the outcomes, The other two post answers to your question are very good and I dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but I will offer one other option I have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks nbspChain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were nbspSee

Weve been together almost three years We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me Its hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry How can this be resolved We have kids and I dont want a broken family because we cant communicate, You cant fix this by yourself but I applaud you for trying One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort Im reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when youve done nothing wrong and ignore things youve felt hurt by I sense that youre doing all the workthat its not balancednbsp  I have worked with many couples and Ive learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible anything is possible But in order for change in a couple to occur you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours and who have empathy Your boyfriend doesnt appear to have these components he pushes you away and blames you when hes done something hurtful  Can you be honest with yourself about whats happening I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are I wish you wellnbsp 
I started dating my fianc two years ago My first cousin is married to my fiancs sister There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom, When youre upset about something the first question you can ask yourself is Whose problem is this It is amazing how many problems will disappear right at that point because you realize the problem isnt even yours You cant fix everything in your family You are starting a new family of your own and its time to create a protective bubble around your family unit that keeps other peoples issues away I tell myself Not my pig not my farm not my problem When you stop trying to take care of other peoples problems they are more likely to step up and deal with it themselves  
I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs His coworker sent him an inappropriate video He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that, It sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent Although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child This situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child 
I am married but I had sex with my friend I feel guilty but I feel not guilty too Do I need to feel guilty Its my body and I have full rights to do what I like, Yes of course its your body and you can do what you feel like doing  Do you feel a commitment to your partner  Your guilt probably is pointing out the feeling of having done with your body what your spirit tells you is a violation of the commitment you feel toward your partner  The good news is that this is a moment for you to examine how strong your commitment is to your partner  Find balance between satisfying your freedom to do as you please with your sense of being a partner which means prioritizing the partner once in a while  br 
Ive been with him for a couple months We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me We have our great moments but I just need to focus on my personal situations and I feel he is slowing me down with that I still wanna be with him but not now, Why dont you just tell him everything that you just wrote here  Youre clear in your mind as to what you would like  Unless you have a whole either side to the way you feel everything you wrote here explains your position very well  Good luck in having your conversation

I am a female and I am afraid of having sex I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced I think he thinks Im not a virgin I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body I dont want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex, The greatest sex experience will be with someone who you feel connected to outside the bednbsp This is something that you should feel comfortable in talking with your partner aboutnbsp The relationship needs to be strong before moving to the bed anyways If the love is there he will understand your fears and make you feel comfortable making it a great experiencenbsp br 
I saw my mother cheating on my dad before I said something to her and she said it was in the past Yesterday I saw her texting dirty things to the same guy Should I talk to her again I dont want my parents to go their separate ways I just want her to stop its not fair, You as the child in the middle of your parents problems is the worse position to be innbsp I can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to donbsp Honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the endnbsp br  One thing I would like to noteyour parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating they have already gone their separate waysnbsp br

I work two jobs and go to school for criminal justice Over the summer my father had a stroke It was very devastating My father isnt the same and my family fights every day I have been kicked out the house many times I break down a lot, You undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders Stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule Stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications First and foremost I would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 56 free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress When dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care In other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life Even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress it is inevitable and a part of life but how you deal with stress as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life I hope this helpsbr

I get angry and act out It scares my wife and child, Anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness Its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble Being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations There are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond I would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a Cognitive Behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior In addition I would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed The first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that youre angry Remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion ie disappointment hurt frustration etc Hope this helps

My friend is abusing her prescription medicine Even though she told me she didnt have any more pills I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications, Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean are very caring about her  Unless your friend feels like stopping pills nbsptaking them away will mean she finds them some place else  The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax physically addicted  Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friends life  Her problem is bigger than your ability to care  If you havent already done so tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills  This is not a guarantee that shell stop  It isa way of you showing that you care about her  Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her  Meanwhile knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you  Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself nbspOffer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using 
I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down Its ruining my mood and even my whole self I have trouble sleeping and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me, The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spirit  Are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you  Have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint  Or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say  If actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person  Or you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for you  br  If the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others 
My parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay When they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very

I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to I never fully meet what they want I feel that when I finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me,It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way Is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression If your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them Additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsbrbrOne possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult You ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answerbr br

Me and my adult daughter just do not get along  Shes very belittling to me when I dont agree with her Its almost like she scolds me We get into all out war Shes said I dont support her in what she does and that Ive never loved her She calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names, As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feels  To some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the other  Developing ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lot  One major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adults  Watch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown person  br  The same is true of your daughter nbspShe may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she is  Her needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way

I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again  The social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours but he hasnt called me back I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back  Can he just ignore me, Yes your former social worker should return your phone call  It is the professional ethic to do so and plain human decency to do so  If he doesnt there is nothing you can directly do about the fact of his ignoring you  There are formal complaints you can make which you can consider doing  What matters most is receiving social work service  Stick with looking for another social worker who is willing to help you  The selfdoubts you mention may be worth examining  They do not however excuse the social worker mishandling himself

How do I ever trust another woman I have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that I meet I am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions  Once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application, Im sorry to hear about that situation If the woman was your therapist or had been at one time this could represent a significant ethical violation when she created a dual relationship with you  Even if you were not her client this might still be an ethical violation Counselors are held to a high standard of conduct and honesty at all times  In a situation like this you might consider filing a complaint with the state regulatory board

endif     p classMsoNormalI see a few issues here p classMsoNormalFirst the age of the child is importantspan stylemsospacerunyesnbsp spanIf the child is considered an  adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this   the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed to  be in the session without the childs consent p classMsoNormalSecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a  counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but  not bothspan stylemsospacerunyesnbsp spanThis means that a counselor  should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should  have custody of a childbr p classMsoNormalThird knowing the details of any parenting plan or  separation agreement is importantspan stylemsospacerunyesnbsp  spanGenerally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and  can be present during the childs sessionsspan stylemsospacerunyesnbsp  spanIf a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that  one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can  consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs  sessionsbr In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking  out legal advice specific to your state law    
I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again  The social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours but he hasnt called me back I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back  Can he just ignore me,Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clientsnbsp This is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the callernbsp In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youbrbrIn addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standardsnbsp For example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promisebrbrAll that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlybrbrIn the end I agree with Sherrys advice If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fitbr

I blame my past relationship for it I know it is bad to be this way I want to get past it, We humans are social beings We learn how to BE in relationship as children The caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen perhaps feeling like you dont matter There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure  so congrats on that because clearly you are already there nbspNext Id suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities either as a couple or individuallynbsp 
I was the one who ended it and Im so glad I did It was the best decision I made in my life But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks It is creating a wall in my current relationship, From what you describe about yourself I agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decision  The nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic nature  The way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partner  Once youve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at once  There is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up years  Since generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and werent aware of this until going through this terrible relationship  Congratulations on ending your relationship  br 
I blame my past relationship for it I know it is bad to be this way I want to get past it, How did you come to the conclusion that you are acting needy  Is this what your partner told you or are you feeling this way about yourself  The difference is that what youd like from a relationship may be very reasonable only that your partner is not someone who wants to meet your needs  One way of evaluating whether youre actually needy is whether you feel that you give yourself love take good care of yourself when youre in situations that are not connected to being part of a couple  If being by yourself feels uneasy most of the time then probably practicing selflove consciously treating yourself with consideration and thoughtfulness may help you feel less needy of others  This way when youre with a partner the time together will be in enjoying the partner not getting love because of not figuring out a way of giving love to yourself 
I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years I have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse Can counseling help, Certainly counselling can help however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach This leads to two questions 1 What are the identifiers for the right counsellor and 2 What is the right approach  1 What are the identifiers for the right counsellor The right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall The indepth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their inthemoment experience It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you value you as a human being and value the connection As well it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist gets you br  2 What is the right approachnbsp As Carl Jung stated When the doctor sits down with the patient he or   she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to preverbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development  depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stagebr

Its been like a couple of years that Ive been feeling like this I dont want to selfdiagnose but I get so sad and cry and then I feel better But then I get upset with people so quickly and I hurt their feelings Its this constant rollercoaster and its hard, Hello and thank you for your question Bipolar disorder isnbspgenerallynbspcharacterized by extreme changes in mood ranging from mania highs to depression lows There are different types however so here is anbspwebsite thatnbspgives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionguidebipolardisordermanicdepressionpage2  After reviewing these symptoms if you believe you may have bipolar disorder then you may want to see your primary care provider ornbspa counselor Bipolar disorder is treatable but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management   For example some people may not get regular sleep but proper rest is important for bipolar management A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to makenbsp  The good news is that many people live happy healthy and productive lives with bipolar disorder So if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder it doesnt mean that things cant get better There is currently no cure for bipolar disorder but with proper medication and lifestyle management people can do quite well  Hope this was helpful Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br 
I recently lost a friend to suicide  Im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it How can I handle this better, Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly Everyone deals with their grief in different ways One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them Some people like to keep the letters in a jar maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area You can find more information on wwwafsporg 
Is this something I should be worried about  Should I do something about it, I recommend asking your son about the reasons he chooses to play alone at recess If he is happy on his own and you know he has some friends I would not be very concerned However there may be bullying going on at school In the case of bullying it may be a situation where you as his parent will need to step in 
Im transgender I know I am but Ive only told a few friends I know I cant tell my family because of previous conversations weve had They just wouldnt accept it  My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own I need some strategies for dealing with it What should I do, Hello and thank you for your question I am so glad that you reached out for help I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are You may already know some of these resources but I am going to share a few   1 The website wwwletsqueerthingsupcom is a blog from a very good writer that I know His name is Sam Dylan Finch and he is transgender He writes about mental health transgender issues and many other topics I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it You may want to check out his site and do a search on there   2 The website wwweverydayfeminismcom employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it If you search for gender dysphoria on their site many articles pop up It may be a good resource for you especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back   3 I am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community So if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach In addition feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in   4 If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups Gaining more support from others would be helpful Sometimes LGBTQfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers   5 Finally I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal but I also know that it is very common for people to considernbspsuicide when they are struggling with dysphoria dealing with transphobia etc If this ever happens to you please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline Its freenbspatnbsp8775658860 Visit their site at wwwtranslifelineorg   br  I hope some of these ideas help Feel free to send another message if you have a followup question  Be wellbe YOU  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br

I started having anxiety three months ago Im new to having anxiety and its making me depressed, I agree with Cory Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT does seem to help a lot of people who struggle with anxiety Its not the only type of therapy that can help but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic As Cory mentioned anxiety is something that is part of life so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable   Our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to STOP any and all things that may cause it or provoke it We do this because we think it will help but it actually doesnt Anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the futurenbspwhile ignoring the present ACT helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies   Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br  br  br  br 
Is this something I should be worried about  Should I do something about it, The answer depends on how the other areas of your sons life are doing  Is he happy or does he seem happy playing alone during recess  Does he have friends in other social circles besides the students whom hes with at recess  How is his academic progress  How is his social integration among his classmates  Are there any special or unusual circumstances in the home and family environment  Go through this list to form a fuller idea of whether your son simply likes alone time and takes this option during recess or if any if the above areas show stress or difficulty for him and which need to be further understood and handled 
Is this something I should be worried about  Should I do something about it, Humans are social creatures so this can be an alarming thing for a parent to deal with just like adults children are not the same and some children are more social than others if he plays alone at recess all the time it would worry myself as well however recess is only one domain of life does he have friends outside of school or daycare Does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs If this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on if perhaps it is occurring just during recess it could be something else altogether I would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate further  Hope this helps  Cbr

I have no friends no hobbies and no interest in anything I get annoyed with everything and everyone I am always tired i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired  I dont know what to do Is this normal, Hello and thank you for your question It certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going Here are a few thoughts and ideas  1 If you havent seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age It doesnt hurt to get checked out If they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms In addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression So dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression Medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors  2 You may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place This could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things   3 Finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that YOU are Millions of people struggle with depression So remember the symptoms are the problem not YOU   br  Hope this helps Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br 
Im a guy If I dont like girls nor do I like guys does that mean Im gay, Hi and thanks for your question I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality but I want too add a couple of things about that  Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality    httpwwwasexualityorghome  There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex and that is not always the case There are variations of asexuality Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others dont Also once you read more on this topic you may find that you dont connect with asexuality either and that is okay   Our society usually thinks of sexual orientationsnbspasnbsponly being straightnbspgay lesbian or bisexual but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations Keep exploring There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do   Finally labels are important for a lot of things but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly This is your journey Your experience Take all the time you neednbspYou may never feel the need to labelnbsphow you feel and that is okay too   Hope this helps Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  nbsp  br  br  br

I was in a relationship for almost five years We were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship He was a caring friendly and charming guy up until three and a half years in He started controlling me who I hung out with where I was at all times and he had a huge hissy fit if I tried to ask him the same questions All that time he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my socalled friends At the end he was a nasty and narcissistic person Now its hard to be social,It sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people It is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with othersbrbrTherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want Often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionshipbr

After I told them they yelled at me, Hello and thank you for your question I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family I truly wish Inbspcould give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately I cant do that Their acceptance of younbspis a journey just like coming out is a journey for you   Sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive Unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen So here are a few things I would suggest  Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are That wont take the place of your familys acceptance and I wont even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most And that is really important   Patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some When families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock And then sometimes even grieving They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden These things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience If it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away   I do recommend setting upnbspsome personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing   They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around They may or they may not And if they dont you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are To be surrounded by folks who remind you of thatnbsp  If you startnbspseeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting withnbspcounselor may be a great idea I am bias probably but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea nbsp  Hope this helps Be well Be you   Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br

I live a normal life I have tons of friends and family but I feel lonely, This may be happening because you and the others are not connected to each other on a level which reaches your emotions  Loneliness may show the absence of feeling a variety of emotions when you are among others  How many friends you have doesnt affect whether you and someone else feel emotionally engaged with one another  Consider if you feel like concentrating your friendship on more intensively sharing your feelings with a few of your friends  This may lead to fewer friends who are also more meaningful to you and your feeling a decrease of loneliness 
I have twin toddlers I experienced a death of loved one prior to giving birth I had a horrible break up with the father People told him he was using me for money My exboyfriend had extreme meltdowns every day for three years Im always alone with no friends, First let me say that you are a survivor and a warrior Managing 1 child by yourself is difficult but twins is a whole different ballgame Anxiety can affect us at any time anywhere This is the challenge especially when we have so many things to manage each day There are several methods and practices that help manage and even reduce symptoms of anxiety It will depend on what works best for you Talk with friends a counselor or a loved one who can offer you support and feedback as you navigate this process of learning what works for you When all else fails make sure you are in a safe place pause for a deep cleansing breath in a long exhale out and ask yourself What do I want in this moment Now you can begin againbr 
When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out She is a bright student always has a 40 but I am afraid she is stressing too much Im afraid its going to break her I dont know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal, Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult On a very basic level There exists a primal need to protect them from harm The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older At some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts Children no longer need the basics food shelter water safety as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes This is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it br 
I often get the feeling that Im being watched like video cameras are hidden wherever I am even at home I feel like people can see all that I do and are reading my thoughts Things I read or hear on the radio seem to be about or meant for me and people are talking about me when they whisper,It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored with no privacy even in your own mind and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media Its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist There is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy lifebr br 
I have absolutely nothing to do with my life but lay in bed on my phone or hangout with my one friend I dont have a job my family doesnt include me in anything and I dont have many friends I have nothing to do besides go on my phone I miss talking to people in person instead of online I dont even talk to my family in person even from the other room,It sounds like you are feeling pretty stuck lonely and hopeless like you have a desire to be more connected to people and to find purpose in life but are not sure what to do I am glad to hear that you have at least one friend and I think it is great that you are reaching out for more connection If you can working with a therapist who is competent in treating depression may be a huge benefit to you and help you to regain a sense of meaning motivation and connection Additionally anything you can do to give yourself a little break from the feeling of pointlessness and any ruminating thoughts you may be having may be of help I know it may sound pointless in the moment and you may feel a great deal of inertia in doing so but you may find that if you force yourself to do something small that is pleasurable like taking a walk for example theres a good chance you will be glad that you did so after the fact Thank you for reaching outbr
I sleep a lot Music changes my mood I cry every Wednesday My mind is like a maze that even I get lost in I dont usually feel my true emotions but instead I get fake mirrored ones, What happens in your life on Wednesdays that you feel like crying nbsp Crying is natural nbspCrying on Wednesdays may also be natural if some type of regular event or situation comes up for you then that you dont like feel oppressed by and have no way of avoiding  Maybe you would qualify for a diagnosis for depression  This matters less than what you will do with a diagnosis nbsp  Very often people feel some type of relief from hearing a professional tell them what they have  Dont let yourself get talked into taking pills because now you have something nbsp  Pills change your mood  Only you can change your life  The diagnosis matters so the therapist gets paid from insurance  It is a good sign that you know whether you feel true emotions or fake ones nbspThis is a clear sign of knowing about yourself  Your mind feeling like a maze is a little too vague to know if you mean there are too many thoughts at once so that you have difficulty knowing which ones to examine first or if maze means you dont know what your thoughts are and nbspfeel lost for this reason  Depression which is addressed by a person can become quite liberating because you will remove what bothers you so much in your life that it weighs you down and depresses you  br  br 
I am not sure if I am depressed I dont know how to bring it up to my parents and that makes me miserable, Depending on your relationship with your parents inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step nbspIf they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them nbspInviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting nbspthis can help keep you on pointnbsp 
My husband and I are separated He says he needs some time apart He says he needs to get back the in love part of a relationship but doesnt want to lose me Should I wait or start over new, Its not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time It is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent If you and your husband have been together for quite some time its likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other While this is a good thing in some ways it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that in love feeling he is referring to Couples simply become ambivalent   For some of the couples I work with in my practice I find that helping to organize a time apart which I call a Therapeutic Separation can do wonders for the relationship I offer homework to be done during this time Reading worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship It often times brings more appreciation for their partners When the pair comes back together we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before br 
Im a teenager and I just got my first job I am a month and a half in Yesterday my boss pushed me to the point where I had to go to the restroom and cry She didnt see me and Im glad but when I went to talk to her about it today I let a tear or two come out I hate it I feel like theyre not going to keep me anymore, How sad for you  Im sorry your first job is turning into a place of tension  Did the matter between you and your boss get resolved  Do you feel respected by your boss and does she listen to your point of view even if afterwards she disagrees  Keep an open mind over the next several weeks or few months on how you feel in your new work situation  Expect to be treated fairly and reasonably  If this is not the way you feel most of the time then consider finding a new place to work 
When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out She is a bright student always has a 40 but I am afraid she is stressing too much Im afraid its going to break her I dont know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal, I agree with your observation about your daughter feeling stressed nbsp  Are you able to open this topic in conversation with her  Also reflect on your own expectations as a parent nbsp  It is possible that your daughter is trying to please you by getting consistently high grades  If your daughter prefers talking in confidence to a therapist then this may help her regain a sense of balance in her life so that schoolwork feels less stressful  I wouldnt take her to a doctor because based on what you write the problem is psychological and emotionally based nbspWhile the stress may have physical symptoms addressing the root cause of the problem has nothing to do directly with something being physically wrong with your daughter  Unless there is some other medical or physical problem that would explain your daughters sense of stress nbspId start first by bringing your areas of concern to your daughter then possibly to a therapistnbsp 
I am not sure if I am depressed I dont know how to bring it up to my parents and that makes me miserable, I am so sorry you are struggling nbspI do think its a good idea to share your feelings with your parents and perhaps get some help connecting with a counselor or therapist if you feel that might help nbspThere are lots of ways to tell them depending on your relationship nbspMaybe saying I wanted to tell you guys something sometimes I worry that I might be depressed Or some folks will write a letter or even send a text nbspThe most important thing is that you tell someone you trust so you dont feel so miserable I hope this helps nbspBest of luck nbsp  br

He is an adolescent He has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video We have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment but after a few months of having then back he pees his pants again, Sounds as though your son is pissed off about something  Punishment will most likely result in more of the same not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happening  Laziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own merit  Is this your description of your son or his description of himself  First step always before addressing any of the family dynamics emotions and psychology of the people involved is a medical rule out as to why your son pees at times he plays video gamesbr  If he has medical clearance that there is no physiological nbspproblem then talk with your son on his opinions as to why he pees if he is aware of the urge to pee and ignores it or that his attention gets so absorbed he doesnt notice the urge to pee  See what modifications you can create by cooperating with your son  Maybe it is as simple as each two hours he sets a timer and when it goes off he takes a bathroom break

I have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month, Are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking life  Dreams and nightmares are the nonlogical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking world  Besides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct control  Your nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life nbsp  Pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking life  If you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare or taken advantage of or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare then look for where in waking life you may feel similar  In this way youll become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares

My mother has Alzheimers and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic silly or meaningless items  I get so frustrated and angry but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isnt her fault  How can I cope with feeling like this, Yes certainly your moms difficulty in having meaningful conversations with people results from the Alzheimers disease process which weakens her brain function  Feeling a sense of guilt in relation to a parent is pretty common for everyone  This is because as little kids and babies we had a strong reliance on a parent and believing every word they sad and wishing to follow each action they ask or demand was for the benefit of our own survival  One way of coping with your feeling of guilt is to examine it  Ask what it is youre feeling guilty about  Chances are that your sense of guilt is less due to what youre currently saying or doing to help your mom  Very likely your guilt feeling is awakening the sense of obligation that you and all of us feel toward a parent simply because parents seem to have unquestionable power when we are very young  After all youre thoughtful enough to write a question so chances are great that youre already actively involved in caring for your mom 
My mother has Alzheimers and I can see that she has lost some of her intellectual abilities  Even though I know this disease is not her fault Im still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes and seems, Good observation on your part to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward you  Has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you  If prior to the onset of Alzheimers she never examined her way of relating to you and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue  She may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because shes been stuck in this attitude for most of your life  The good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom has very little to do with the way she relates to you  This is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimers began  You can however feel a little more free knowing that youre not deserving of being ignored

Shes in her early 20s and she has a toddler, Well first lets identify what factors are involved in the situation about which you wrote  Are you the only decision maker regarding your stepdaughter living with you  Is her dad and your partner living under the same roof  Would you feel any obligation to consult with your husband about his opinion and his way of handling the situation  Have you talked with your stepdaughter about your observation and your reaction to the fact of her not honoring your boundaries  Consider too that there will be an effect on the toddler your grandchild if you kick out your daughter  Is your daughter financially ready to live on her own and support herself and her child  You certainly have the right to define the terms of what goes on under your roof  It is only fair to everyone that as many variables as possible be considered  The conclusion may be that it is in everyones best interest for your stepdaughter to move out  If everyone feels respected and a well thought out plan is developed then the least amount of hurt and stress and the most amount of happiness will be possible from this change  br 
Nothing weve tried has worked so far, Probably what you should do is decide whether you can continue having a romantic and sexual relationship with someone to whom you dont feel like having sex  Five years is long enough to know that the way you feel toward your partner is more than likely going to remain this way  Talk with your gf about your feelings because she may not wish to be in a relationship in which her partner is not sexually attracted to her 
Any time my family and friends are in an altercation Im the one who steps in Im the one they call to fight for them I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people Im fighting for Im only in my early 20s, Breaking the patterns of relating to family members is difficult work  In the situation you describe both you and the family members who ask for your intervention will be affected by any change you decide to make in the way all of you handle family disagreements  Always it is best for any two people who have a disagreement to talk directly with each other nbsp A third person distracts from the content and reasons for disagreeing  Maybe knowing that by pulling yourself away from mediating family arguments you will in the long term be doing good for your family helps you do the actual work of separating yourself from their arguments  Definitely the fact that youre writing about the problem shows you feel like doing something which feels better than how you feel currently  It is very healthy for you to listen to your gut intuition telling you to pull out of the mediator role you are in currently  You may feel guilty your family members will most likely do everything possible to persuade convince nbspand push you back into their arguments  This doesnt make them right in what theyre doing it only makes your job harder of trying to let them have their fights on their own

In the last ten months Ive been kicked out moved around three times worked many jobs stopped school to make money had dad and mom get sick was cheated on while pregnant lost my baby had relationship issues and was betrayed I cant get a job I have no friends I feel lonely and isolated Ive been dealing with all this by myself, One thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over If you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices For example you say you cant get a job but I wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job like Career Link You say you have no friends currently Are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact with  You mentioned that you have no friends Is there anyone in your life that you can talk with even if its not someone that you consider a closest friend 
My daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying calm down when she dropped her phone Within seconds the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb saying horrifically unspeakable things and her calling the cops on me She seems unable to stop herself at times, Bipolar disorder has a lot of different components If this is a onetime event it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to calm down may have made her feel as though you werent understanding what she was saying Bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression When this is coupled with intense anger and acting or speaking without thinking these can be part of bipolar disorder but that wouldnt be the whole picture of what bipolar disorder would look like It may be helpful to track differences that you notice in your daughters mood and any patterns related to the times of day or what seems to lead her to be upset Patterns are very helpful in figuring out what is happening 
Im a teenager and I created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if Im worried or upset She gives me advice and comforts me and tells me itll be okay Ive given her a name Solace and created a personality for her thats like a comforting motherly figure I know its just my own advice and my own thoughts but its just that Im thinking of them through a voice other than my own I do this because I know I never really listen to my own advice and I thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out through this imaginary friend Is this normal Could it develop into a separate personality with time if I continue a mentality that she is her own person, Since you are saying that you know that the thoughts are yours and your thinking of them in a different persons voice to make them easier for you to follow through on it doesnt sound like it could develop into another personality  It may be helpful to also find other things that give you comfort and to practice telling yourself that it will be okay in your own voice If you start to do that slowly it may be more comfortable for you If youre following following through with your own advice it sounds like some part of you knows that you are making choices that you agree with  What else gives you comfort Maybe theres a room that you like to be in when you are home or a certain outfit or color that makes you feel good Focusing on these things may also be comforting to you 
My exboyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now Hes in his late 20s divorced for like five years now with two kids He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors He lies and cheats but I love him Ive tried to date other people but I always go back to him, There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave Can you have open conversations about your concerns Is he able to listen to that Im not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats but does he recognize these things as problems Which part of you is bigger the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave Can you consider what you want wish for and desire while also considering the same for him Can he do that for you 
My mom and dad got divorced four years ago I had to finish out the school year with my dad and now they are deciding which place is best for me I cant choose How can I choose if I love both places, I dont know how old you are but depending on that you may be able to talk with them about spending some time in both places Even parents who live in different states can do that sometimes Its not as frequent as spending one week at one house and the next week and the other but I know that it happens  If you can talk with both of your parents about how you would like to live in both places maybe you can all work out some kind of agreement 
Ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables but I always seem to eat the junk in the house, I know some people do better when they dont have as much junk food in the house This is not as tempting then Having said that maybe you can reward yourself with different things such as having dessert on certain days If you are concerned about mostly eating habits consider seeing a nutritionist They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals Im not sure how this links to happiness for you but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier 
I get really mad easily at my parents and family, Anger is not necessarily a bad thing If you are angry and you can talk about your feelings that would be very helpful Anger usually comes along with something else like feeling sad worried overwhelmed confused and many others Consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point If you get along well with friends and dont get angry with them look at the differences Do you feel criticized by your parents or family Misunderstood There could be any number of things  I wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly Try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry Anger is a real emotion in itself It almost always connects to something else as well 
My daughter is in later elementary school She cant color in the lines Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines, Its hard to tell from the information that you were able to provide here but talk with her elementary school a guidance counselor Someone working with the school usually a school psychologist should be able to evaluate her to see if she needs extra help and to tell you more clearly what may be happening 
Im dating a guy I really love We have our problems but I could see myself with him long term But theres this other guy who Ive had feelings for for awhile now He gives me butterflies when we talk and my heart beats fast when I see hes texted me which i never felt with my current boyfriend, There are different types of attraction nbspYou said that youve never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend Depending on how long youve been together and if youre looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level thats a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different Some people look at it as a difference between levels of passion and compassion but there are many different terms to try to talk about it  Perhaps with this guy that you really love you could talk about ways to keep things new and different in the relationship Maybe you can leave notes for each other during the day or have a small surprise at random intervals maybe an invitation to a picnic for example  As for the other guy who makes your heart beat faster what do you see in him You said you really love the other guy which is why Im asking  What do you look for in the person who you want to be with longterm whoever that is 
Im starting to think that I might have depression The thing is though Im not exactly sad I can joke with my friends and stuff but Ive stopped caring about my work and Ive been starting to think that life is pointless I really have no clue if I need help or if Im just tired or something, It is possible that you have depression but you could also be experiencing some other changes that mean that you have feelings of being sad without actually being depressed Your statement makes it sound like youve stopped caring about your work but youre still going to work and doing your work It almost sounds like you are dissatisfied with your work Do you like what you donbsp  When you said that life is pointless what makes it that way What is keeping you going Is there something you can do each day that you can find meaning in  You mentioned that you are not sure if you need help or are just tired It sounds like you could certainly benefit from talking with someone about more specifics  Im curious about how long you have felt this way and if you are aware of anything that is contributing to it 
I used to be the funny guy of the groupthe class clown if you will I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward Now I cant laugh at all and Im dead inside, If you look back to when you feel as though you were the funny guy I wonder what is different now It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things  I dont know whether youre also saying that you feel sad or if youre saying that you feel as though you dont have any big changes in your feelings  A lot of us tend to be really busy and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we dont have time to have positive time for ourselves Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends were thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do  I wonder if it feels awkward when youre with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to Maybe if that is more comfortable for you it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments  It sounds as if you may have had an experience or more than one where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward If so try going back to people you trust Who do you have support from 
I have friends family I live in a good home I go to a nice high school and I get pretty good grades but I dont know why Im so unhappy These friends are my best friends and theyre all amazing people and yet Im sad all the time and feel alone, I wonder if you have moments where you feel happy  You say you have amazing friends I wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around them  Sometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do really well at everything all the time and this can be overwhelming sometimes Where do you have support I hope you can tell someone that you are feeling sad so that you can talk about your feelings  Sleeping can make a big difference as far as feeling sad as well If youre not sleeping well at night that could be a big part of feeling sad a lot  Perhaps you could try to find a person or two who makes you feel totally safe and comfortable and try to talk with them 
My fiance is always letting me know how I am a horribleevil person or I just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day, One thing you could try is to have a conversation when neither of you is upset so that you learn what makes each of you feel cared for and valued It could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesnt quite match what she is really looking for in that moment For example having an indepth conversation could be something that you want but she may just want a hug in that momentnbsp  I dont know if you heard of Gary Chapmans book about love languages but it may be helpful 
I no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fiance, Sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreement  You could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiance is open to that  Something else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion The reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again This only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though 
I stopped for a while but Ive started doing it again Its like an addiction The more I try to stop the more I want to do it Ive tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw but it doesnt work, Ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions Youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on While that is still something to work on it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead You said drawing doesnt work for you Sometimes more physical activities such as doing a few jumping jacks can be helpful If you dont exercise it might be something to talk with your doctor about first  The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that Try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut 
When Im sad and alone I want to cut myself, Try doing something physical If you havent exercised before it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first but this can be helpful  The more you can find out about when you want to cut the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do If you are feeling sad or angry or nervous look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about that  You said you are alone I would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through This could be a parent a friend someone at school a coworker or any number of other people 
She has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and Im her caregiver All she does is complain hit me call me names and say things happened that didnt When I tell her she explodes I didnt always hate her but now every little thing she does irritates me and I dont have the means to live on my own, It sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating her  span stylelineheight 142857Something you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom I dont know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help If you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together Do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects youspan  span stylelineheight 142857From whom do you have support during all of thisspan 
She works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out, I wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about This can often change the way that we look at different situations Try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings before  If you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you Then you could talk about feelings that youre having 
I get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two It usually happens in bed at night but I occasionally experience this during the day I have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this, Im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening I know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician Ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature As far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on These are just some thoughts but I think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start 
I know I was molested as a child but I have no memory of it, Im not sure that I have the answer to your question but I can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist There are a list of them herenbspa hrefhttpwwwnatboardcomindexfilesPage548htmhttpwwwnatboardcomindexfilesPage548htma You also may want to talk to someone who specializes in EMDR This stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment I am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started 
I think i may suffer from depression and it is affecting my life and sleep I am on my parents insurance and they wont let me see a therapist because they dont believe in it, The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live In Pennsylvania anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment As for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies If you are under 18 you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment If you are over 18 there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies  If you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school This would not require using your insurance 
I feel depressed even though I act like a happy with my family I act like Im happy so my son doesnt see me sad I act like my life is a happy life but I feel sad and depressed I sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me I just cry and write in my book all these feelings, It sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time I would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist If you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment please call 8002738255 and talk to someone  While I follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else Who is it that you trust or could speak with about this A therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as well  One thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy This could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it If you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy You could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safe  Have you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sad  Can you think of anything that makes you feel good even if it only works for a few minutes 
Any time my family and friends are in an altercation Im the one who steps in Im the one they call to fight for them I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people Im fighting for Im only in my early 20s, You could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting A lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain For other people conflict is just hard to watch andor listen to  As for having a tough time trusting them that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned It can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you dont know when the next big fight or argument is going to start  The next time you step in for someone consider asking yourself what is making you do that What are you feeling in the moment 
Two years ago I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues It has emotionally destroyed me I now basically hate myself Its embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone My family has been in the armed forces and it has always been my dream I cant do this alone anymore and now my family is even worried, It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support  Is there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life I dont know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different direction  Your military service will always be a part of you Thank you for your service 
Shes in her early 20s and she has a toddler, It may be helpful to first have a discussion about what you are expecting and put a timeframe on it that if she is not doing certain things by a certain date she will have to leave If you dont know where she can go there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in 
Nothing weve tried has worked so far, Sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy You could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable After doing this for nonsexual touching it can also be used with sexual touching Looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help 
Everything just makes me upset, Anger often comes with a lot of other emotions Consider what else you may be feeling at the same time and keep track of your different mood changes You may be able to notice patterns such as being more frustrated when you dont sleep well If you do feel as though you are mad all the time can you think of any exceptions so you can see what is different in those times 
Ever since I was little I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them I treated everyone nice For girls I liked I would spend every second with them It always ends the same way I like you as a friend or I love your attention but not you, Attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time Maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection 
My father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia I have been dealing with that all day My husband keeps getting mad at me for things that I said, I dont know how long you have been married but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment It could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong Maybe he would be open to an honest discussion 
My stepdad and I always mess around Ive noticed that whenever he playfully hits me its always my butt that he hits He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room Im a teenager female and I want to know if this is normal, Its hard to tell from the way you described it Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter As far as scanning you from head to toe I can think of reasons that parents might do that I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are That way it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are 
She was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it  She has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home We do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy, There are many possible answers here It could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things Will she talk about it when shes not mad You mentioned that she has an attachment issue It could also be that she was attached to the house Its not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot 
Sometimes when I look at my pet cat I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him It makes me sad because I love him but I always think about how helpless he is Thereve even been splitseconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him followed by shame and guilt, A lot of different things could be happening here Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is If you have not actually kicked him then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him What else is there  It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you It could be that you feel safe with your cat so strong emotions come up because you feel safe 
I dont have time to live or take care of myself at times Its causing depression stress and anxiety I dont know what to do, Im not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start 
I was a victim of an incident Ive been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because I dont feel anyone honestly believes me There are so many other factors I deal with on a daily basis I ignore my problems when Im with my friends but its scary when Im alone, Im glad you have some time when youre not thinking about your trauma when youre with your friends  As far as feeling scared when you are alone Im not sure if you are referring to having flashbacks or thoughts on what happened to you or reminders in the environment around you or something else  One thing that might help is to find a bead or a rock that is smooth that you can hold onto or rub against your hand or fingers Think of a time when you felt safe comfortable happy  basically a positive and safe moment  while holding onto the rock Then when you have scary thoughts you can hold on to the rock and remember the happier place Try to associate as many happy and safe moments with the rock as you can 
I have three siblings My mom loves them and not me Shes always yelling at me but when it comes to my siblings she talks to them Im always crying in my room, Have you ever tried talking with her about this when shes not angry While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesnt love you there could be a lot of other pieces to this Have you ever told her about how much she means to you when shes not angry 
Over the years I have slowly lost everything my jobs my cars my freedom and my money I am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money doesnt have a car never goes out and cleans all day long everyday, There are an infinite number of possibilities here You included a lot of things that you dont have Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together I dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future  I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you I dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted If you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen  Also again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room For example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do 
My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriendslovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts It causes me to get jealous because Im afraid they might reconnect somehow Ive attempted to talk to her about it but she avoids it and doesnt seem to worry about how I feel about it, Talking about it would probably be helpful if youre both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you After one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say This can lessen confusion  I know you say that she avoids it It might be a good place to start talking about it  to see what makes her avoid it It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them I dont know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well 
Im not the same anymore I dont know how to get back to who I am Im sad and confused and angry and tired I dont sleep well, Being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions If youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day Also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed If you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed Hopefully youll be able to establish a pattern  Sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well Try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes  If youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician There are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you 
Im in my early 20s and Ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently He has made comments such as you would look better as a Tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats Its really hurtful, My first thought was that I wondered what changed recently Is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that one  Its possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts you  Try asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important I dont know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly Then you can listen to his side of the concern 
I try to do everything right just so we wont argue and it doesnt help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol I get anxiety over having fights with him, Because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fights  When you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue It sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively I recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm 
Im in my early 20s My exs parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me I left my ex due to an abusive situation and they are making me look like I was the bad one, Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex that could be one element of the discussion but it doesnt have to be  I dont know how long we have been together with your current partner but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time That may be a discussion to have with them as well  Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations 
Im in a relationship with my childs father Im a really jealous person We dont go out or do anything with other people because of me To keep our relationship going I know I have to stop being jealous but I cant How can I get over these issues, It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it If youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous I dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past  Also it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other at least to some degree  Also consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this You cannot make him do anything to support you with this but you can certainly ask  What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal 
Im depressed and recently went through a break up Its like every guy I like only wants me for sex I think Im ugly and sometimes I just want to die I have a son and I got really big when I was pregnant I have stretch marks on my stomach, If you are currently feeling as if you want to die please call 8002738255 and talk to someone  One way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you Do you have friends or family who are supportive  Can you find one part of you that you do not think is ugly  If your stretch marks are still bothering you talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician Sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right direction  You mentioned mostly physical things here I wonder if you can find one small thing each day that is going right and build from there Perhaps your son makes you smile 
Im feeling rejected and frustrated This is not new The first month we were together sex was about every day Then it slowed down to once a month right away I love my husband but I am struggling with this, Have you said anything to your husband about the way youre feeling  Start with this  Sex is after all a two person enterprise  If he would like to talk about the way youre feeling great and wonderful nbspThe two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationship  If he doesnt want to talk about how youre feeling then youre facing a different problem  Your feelings are real and need to be handled  If you end up facing your feelings of frustration about your husband not wanting to have sex with you on your own then does your husband give you a truthful sounding reason as to why not  Ask what explains his disinterest in having sex with you  If he doesnt want to address this question then you are a little further down the rung of trust and care about you  Depending on how satisfied you are with his answers will guide you on how much dissatisfaction you can live with and why longterm 
I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety I also have voices in my head I have problems sleeping too Ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder I have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal How do I tell them this and ask for therapy, What stops you now from telling your parents the way you are feeling  Do you imagine asking them for therapy would be a surprise for them  If theyre paying attention to you at all then I imagine theyd feel relief to know youre aware of having some feelings within yourself of a problem  If you believe theyd have a negative reaction to you asking for help this may very well be part of why you are having problems in the first place  What reaction did your parents have when you were diagnosed with the other conditions  Id separate their willingness to help you from your sense of needing help  If they do not want to help with finding a therapist for you then start by looking for services available for people in your age group whose parents also do not wish to be involved in their childs emotional and psychological health 
I was born a girl I look like a boy I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender I dont know what to say if someone asks my gender I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender, It is ok to tell someone who is casually asking about your gender what is written on your birth certificatenbsp  Measure the significance of your answer to the significance of the person who is asking you the question  In addition you are stating the simple truth so theres nothing wrong with stating what is on your birth certificate  Do you understand the reason of why people are asking about your gender  It is not a common question so I wonder about the context in which this happens  The whole field of gender identity is extremely popular now  Popular usually means people are swept into a trend just because it is in the air not because theyve given the time and seriousness to thoughtfully consider if the trend has anything to do with them personally  Keep open minded to who you are including if you are truly a different gender than the one youre born into  It is a very complicated question and lately people especially teens are answering it much more rapidly than seems possible to fully consider 
Im trying to make marriage work after a split Before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me I dont think he cheated Last month I asked what women work with him so he told me Yesterday I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about Should I be upset, Are you upset is the more pertinent question  Everyone has their own tolerance for lies and their unique reasons for being married nbspTrust your own answers to the question you ask here  Also think over the value of your marriage in your life and whether you are able to live with the unstable sense of trust that you have in your husband  Remember too that if you are the only partner who is trying to make the marriage work then your job is much harder than if your husband actively participated in making the marriage happier for the couple 
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything I was very embarrassed, Everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back the person wishes they hadnt  The key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doing  Your mistake sounds genuine not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyone  Now that this student in your class pointed out your mistake you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwear  Put in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall you generally do most activity in your life in nonfoolish ways  The incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible nbspThe mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for you  I hope youll enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain 
We have been together over a year We spend time together every day no matter how busy He started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight He also began to be distant and sexually selfish We had a argument and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer He wont treat it, I wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now That doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wants  You may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship Both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one another  I would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone else  It may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones

Maybe this is a stupid question but I sometimes dont know whats real or not If feel at times like everyones lying How do I know if God is one of those lies, Your question is actually thoughtful and reflects a true interest to know more about life  No one knows if god is a lie because god is a concept in which people either make up their own definition of this concept or believe one of the concepts of what god is handed down by religions  All the religions exclude the other god concepts and expect loyalty to believing in their particular version of god  Probably god is real in the sense that most people want to believe there is guided purpose to what goes on in life  This is as definite as what we can know about god  God is not a lie because it is not a fact nbspBeliefs arent provablenbsp

Maybe this is a stupid question but I sometimes dont know whats real or not If feel at times like everyones lying How do I know if God is one of those lies, There are an infinite number of ways to look at this Spirituality religion God higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people My question for you is what does real actually mean to you Often the concept of God has to do with what you believe in If you ask 1000 different people youll probably get almost that many different answers  Consider talking with friends or family about this I would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do You may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure The local Salvation Army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services There may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussion  Just a word of caution In my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe Some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others When initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality A second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions  As far as whether God is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process 
I have known I was always different This year in December I found out that I never felt female I did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad, Hello and thank you for your question This is certainly a tough spot I have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things   You may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues or if you have ever heard him talk about it That may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you For example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot Has he had an opinion This wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people   To tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you There is no right or wrong way best or worst If you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him Thats perfect Want to have a friend with you for support Equally perfect Whatever thing you need to do And of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so   Unfortunately the response from your dad cant be predicted Some parents are totally cool others not so much This is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea If things get heated you have someone in your corner   There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him You can also Google some stories about how others came out  I refer many people to the wwwletsqueerthingsupcom blog It is a popular blog written by a trans man that I know He writes on many topics related to trans issues   Hope some of these suggestions help Be well be you and good luck  br  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   br  br  br 
Maybe this is a stupid question but I sometimes dont know whats real or not If feel at times like everyones lying How do I know if God is one of those lies, The way that I see it is that Humans have always been afraid of life and death historically we have always tried to understand life we try to organize it categorize it explore it and weve built up this system our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and death is this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements it is no matter how you try to argue it a false system of conditioning humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be God has been developed over time as a security blanket for our childlike selves the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way On Earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought economics societal structures and so on it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at BaskinRobbins so then I ask you which one is real and what is realbr

Im feeling rejected and frustrated This is not new The first month we were together sex was about every day Then it slowed down to once a month right away I love my husband but I am struggling with this, This could have many different origins Have you tried asking him about it Sometimes starting with asking whether he would be open to having an important discussion can be a good beginning If that starts well perhaps continuing with something like Ive noticed that we havent been together intimately or whatever phrasing works for you as much lately Can you tell me more about what its like for you  When asking questions like this it usually helpful to not overuse and perhaps try to avoid using the word why That word tends to trigger really strong emotional reactions in people Try starting with what makes Instead For example what made you choose not to do that 
I was born a girl I look like a boy I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender I dont know what to say if someone asks my gender I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender, If youre feeling like your gender is different than the gender you are born with and there are many different terms to help describe that Gender is actually looked at on a spectrum Transgender is just one of those terms but looking at the information here may helpnbspa hrefhttpwwwtransequalityorgabouttransgenderhttpwwwtransequalityorgabouttransgendera Im not saying that you should use the term transgender to describe yourself because that may not accurately describe what you are experiencing but Im just trying to point you to some more resources  As for what to say to someone who asks your gender that becomes a question with a lot of different parts This is probably something that would be best talked out with someone else who you trust I dont know whether that is your family friends and mental health professional and member of the clergy or someone else There are many different things than you could say and they are all related to how much you already to share with other people about how you feel regarding your gender  Generally I would suggest it would be important to become comfortable with how you feel yourself and possibly tell some people whom you really trust first Also consider that once you tell someone something its not possible to undo it so if you tell someone they may tell someone else Then there is also the matter of people having very different reactions related to different genders and not everyone will be supportive I hope that you are able to surround yourself with some people who are willing to understand and work through this with you so that you have some ideas how to react if you come across someone who does not understand  Please remember that there is always someone to talk with 
I am pretty sure I have depression and anxiety I also have voices in my head I have problems sleeping too Ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder I have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal How do I tell them this and ask for therapy, If you have already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those things  It may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past I dont know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them that may be a way to start the process As for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about that  Im not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing but if you have some support there perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as well  You mentioned that sometimes you hear voices This can happen for a variety of reasons but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them that would be a time to ask for immediate help before you follow through with what they are telling you perhaps by calling 8002738255 They may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call 
I have been falling into a deep depression where I can no function during the day and night The only time I am at peace is when Im asleep If I am with friends family at work and mainly alone I cannot think straight I no longer feel like myself, I dont know how long ago your breakup was but I would suggest that you reach out to friends or family that you trust and perhaps a local mental health clinician  Im not sure what you mean when you say that you are not able to function during the day and night If you are having trouble sleeping for more than a few nights consider talking with your primary care physician Not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much larger  Can you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup This may be a starting point for you I wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake Also consider looking at things that you can control such as when you choose to wear eat and who you talk to about your deepest feelings  You mentioned that you have friends and family I wonder if any of them are supportive to you  Please reach out and talk to someone about the details I get the sense that you feel that you are alone in this and having someone there to help you sort out what youre feeling sounds like it would be a gift to yourselfspan stylelineheight 142857nbspspan 
I cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself, Empathy usually falls on a spectrum meaning that some people show more than others Empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone elses eyes or walk a mile in their shoes There could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencing  Empathy is not usually categorized as an emotion but as something related to emotions For example you could have empathy about someones anxiety  Im not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you dont have sympathy for yourself or others Thats a different concept but also involves different degrees  When you say you dont have emotion except anxiety I wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions If you are experiencing a lot of anxiety try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes This could be any number of activities such as watching TV cooking reading a book or many other options  If you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything if its just been a few days it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days If it has been quite a while consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions There may be some variations that you are not aware of  If you continue to feel anxious and as if you dont have as many emotions as you would like consider talking with your primary care physician or a local therapist

For the past four weeks Ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things Theyre not random voices but rather the voices of those I care about, Are you in the middle of extreme emotional pressure right now  Or is someone with whom youre close under stress or somehow suffering  Dreams and nightmares are when our feelings and pressures we feel try working themselves out without logic and language  Even though the nightmares are horrible they are one way your psyche is trying to come to terms w extraordinary difficulty in your life or someones life whom you feel greatly attached 
I am so terrified of having sex anymore because I have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection My partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex and honestly I want to give that to her, Maybe youll feel less fear by understanding that whoever told you sex was dangerous was wrong  If this message came from your upbringing then it may a deeply embedded belief  Since the belief itself instructs to avoid risk and overturning this belief requires taking the risk to believe the logic that reasonable safe sex measures are adequate protection give yourself time to absorb this new understanding  Talk w your partner about your psychological difficulty bc their patience will help you

Ive been like this ever since I was in school back then I transferred to another school Now Im thinking about changing my job, Theres a quote I love that says Wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by Jon KabatZinn may be very helpful for you The thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing The awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be Through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself If you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist Id recommend looking for someone offering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT or MindfulnessBased Cognitive Behavioral Therapy MCBT Also helpful may be the online program of a hrefhttppalousemindfulnesscomMindfulness Based Stress Reduction MSBR found hereanbspThere are inperson programs across the country but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource 
Ive been like this ever since I was in school back then I transferred to another school Now Im thinking about changing my job, Sometimes changes make sense It may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow Another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult There are many other possibilities along this continuum  I would ask you to consider the following  What is leading you to want to change your job  What feelings are associated with this change Happy sad scared anxiousnervous confused motivated etc  How is the job that you are looking to transfer to going to be better or different Are the concerns that you have now going to travel with you  If you are hesitating to get another perspective from trusted friends or family or some sort of career advisor in your area where is the hesitation coming from 
For the past four weeks Ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things Theyre not random voices but rather the voices of those I care about, I would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going through  I dont know if you can understand when the voices are saying but I wonder how you feel about what you are hearing If the voices are just at night is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dreamnbsp  If you recall your nightmares consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns  One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room youre in For example take time to notice your feet on the floor hips in the chair and shoulders against the back of the chair You can also try mindfulness techniques such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns These ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you  Thanks for reaching out 
I am so terrified of having sex anymore because I have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection My partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex and honestly I want to give that to her, I would suggest possibly talking with a physician about all the different types of protection They may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are available  It sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns Perhaps until you have the chance to speak with someone about the effectiveness of different contraception and forms of protection are either of you open to other forms of engaging in sexual intimacy without penetration but with use of vibrators toys designed for sexual interactions etc 
I have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times I pretend we arent married at my work Recently he has caught on but I lie to cover it He use to talk to girls online but I have caught myself constantly having a affair, It may be helpful to have this emotionally impactful conversation in the context of couples therapy  Whether or not you should get a divorce is not the first question that comes to mind for me but more along the lines of do you want to be together and what kind of relationship do you want to create  For some people polyamorous relationships those involving more than two people are acceptable This does not work for everyone but if each of you agree that that is okay it may work for you and your husband If it is something that you are both open to it is often beneficial to have more than one discussion about the details of what is acceptable for each of you  If you want to be devoted only to each other what does that lifestyle look like for each of you What can you start or stop doing right now to move your relationship in that direction  Neither of you can make the other partner change That does not mean you cannot talk about what each of your goals are together and support each other in working toward those goals you have for yourselves  Sometime having discussions like these is easier when there is a structure andor someone in the room like a therapist who can help keep the conversation on topic and work on having each of you communicate in a way that expresses your wants wishes and desires in a way that is not blaming of your partner  If either of you wants a divorce that could be part of the discussion Divorce is not the only choice here depending upon what each of you wants and is willing to accept learn and grow from as it relates to yourself and your partner 
How can I get to a place where I can be content from day to day, One thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day It could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are but because so many other things are going on you may not notice  Another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day This way when youre having a rough day you have a list to think of and take a look at  Are you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you typically at least two meals per day and roughly 8 hours of sleep that night may be different depending on your age These two ideas are closely related to changes in your mood  From where do you have support Friends or family  Can you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoy  If you think back to the last time that you felt content what was contributing to that  Another possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day For example rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break consider actually tasting it and enjoying it Also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well For example when you finish your paperwork take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your email reading five pages of a book or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task 
I have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household, Something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming Anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for actionnbsp  Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple The first Id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds and then out for 78 seconds Try to repeat this for 35 minutes Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself Try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible nbspCombining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpfulnbsp  If you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then Id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional This professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms 
I have bipolar disorder paranoid personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder I last selfharmed a week ago When I am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all I can think of I am trying to seek help, Seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though nbspto be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety However many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy DBT Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but anbspspan stylelineheight 142857skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotionsnbspspan  span stylelineheight 142857Without knowing your location I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area Calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmednbspspan

I have suffered many things at home and school We never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but I always feel like a part of my heart is missing I try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman, There are a lot of ways to look at this It sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support I wonder what it is that you feel when youre not in a relationship  Because of the way you asked the question Im getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships I wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone Even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner having friends is still an important element  I wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself as far as emotions when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one  Perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself  In general it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others in this case relationship has many meanings and degrees Most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days thoughts feelings etc with someone else who we trust and care about  also hoping they care about us in return 
A year ago the love of my life left me and never looked back Our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart I miss her so much and cant seem to get over  being so heartbroken, I recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life At the same time I dont understand whether you are able to see your son Im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons mother  When you say that she never looked back I imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested in  I would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much Most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died But it also applies to people who have a significant loss whether that is a relationship a job or any number of other things  In the meantime try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus on 
I stress over everything If I dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend I start to feel resentment towards him He has three children and they are great kids but I find we dont have much time together I break down easily and find myself depressed, Everyone has some level of anxiety  its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on However if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then Id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxietynbsp  Your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children As a married stepmother Ive been there and as a therapist I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if youre not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership 
I have been with my boyfriend for more than a year He recently got a new job and travels a lot Im not used to him being gone all the time I feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to  I feel lost sad and unwanted This is really a tough new challenge I just want to break up with him but I love him so much I dont know why he is acting this way lately I believe I have separation anxiety Is there anything that I can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town, Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship And youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible If you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feeling  As far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called SelfHelp for Anxiety Management Theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety The best part is its freenbsp

Im a man and Im soon to be married I have been messing around with other men on the side It started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot I dont know what to do, Hello and thank you for your question When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be Indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives   Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart Whatnbspkind of characternbspdo I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching How would I want others to describe me   Lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic and YOU also valuenbspauthenticitynbspas something you want to live by You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart   This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation So please try not to feel alone We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves   Thinking about your valuesnbspand living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but I wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time For example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove That may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity   It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someones fianc  Above all I wish you well in this journey   br  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC  br  br  br  br  br 
I told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again She started crying because I wouldnt make her daddy die, Children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately It is also very likely that your daughter does not understand nbspthe permanence of death Having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and I would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children  I would also wonder where she is getting this idea Sometimes children hear things on TV or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are remembering  It may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking for  Im curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry Does she say the same sorts of things about you  It may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well 
I get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex, I first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to I dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable  There is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person  Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability If your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions  Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not All of this can be part of your discussions When you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like You may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself  If this feels pretty structured it is initially Generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural  If the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you Even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are span stylefontstyle italic fontweight boldsomespan of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship  If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships 
Both of my parents committed suicide together and I was the one who found them I suffer from overwhelming depression which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives He does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex, Hello and thank you for your question First I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives It may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there So for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as anbsppersonal rejection rather thannbspresponse to stress trauma or grief   If your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy   If he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself And sometimes our personally therapy can influencenbspothers so itnbspmay be a good idea   It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it   I hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also   Be well  br  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC  br  br  br  br  br  br  br  br 
I have suffered many things at home and school We never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but I always feel like a part of my heart is missing I try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman, There could be many reasons but often people feel validated when they are in a relationship the need to be in a relationship can be related to a belief of unlovability which often stems from our childhood The relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief There are many questions that may help understand why how was your relationship with your mother caregivers nbspspan stylelineheight 142857How was your childhood etcnbspspan  Many people describe having a hole or void they try and fill with material things or people but it only is a temporary fix which usually drives the person to the next relationship or object in hopes it will be fulfilling but it never is because fulfillment is work we need to do ourselves This journey involves finding acceptance and love for ourselves Once we have that we dont need to look elsewhere for fulfillment 
Ive been on 05 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month It hasnt been helping me at all but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking Im abusing them I just have very big anxiety attacks Should I stay on the 05mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose Im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,divHello and thank you for your question While counselors work closely with medical providers and sometimes have discussions about medications with people we rarely make recommendations about how much or what typenbspof medicationnbspa person should be taking This is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice The only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician nurse practitioner physicians assistant etc divdivbrdivdivHaving said that I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks you should consider it Medications can be helpful for anxiety and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety longterm divdivbrdivdivTherapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with Exposure therapy hasnbspgood outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks divdivbrdivdivIf you are interested in speaking with your provider about the Xanax I think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine The provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication divdivbrdivdivPlease remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time Medications like Xanax really are highly addictive The more you take the more you may feel you need The more often you may feel you need to use it Depending on the frequency and amount of use some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication divdivbrdivdivIt is a good idea to talk to medicalnbspprovider about all of those things so that you can partner on right course of action to manage this anxiety I certainly hope that you get some relief I know anxiety is awfuldivdivbrdivdivRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC brdiv
Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder There isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in generalnbsp  Anxiety itself is a really natural thing  its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders It might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel span stylefontstyle italicis spannormal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual Working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms This twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like 
I have been feeling more and more down for over a month I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of,It could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms Finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason For example if I am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then I start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically Ill start to see a lot more that I get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself Same with anxiety Obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but thats where working with a counselortherapist comes innbspdivbrdivdivI would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can through the panic attack continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations Even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations youre feeling  such as saying to yourself Okay Im breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight Reminding yourself that its just your bodys reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now youre okay and eventually it will go away I highly recommend the SAM for Anxiety Management app for the anxiety piece and I wouldnt be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression toonbspdiv
Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now She is an adolescent and the problem is mostly food She is now overweight and we just dont know what to do anymore She can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say, I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with Physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning I would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issuenbsp 
Im in my late 50s I never loved or have been loved I need deeper help than is offered in my small town but I cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia I find myself losing hope more and more My brain barely works anymore and my memory so small I forget in a moment I serve no purpose Im incapable of work or anything of value and I never have been Im a complete waste of time and resources and yet I keep trying Why Why does God insist that I continue to exist Im not suicidal just tired,The fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into Why do I keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you goingnbspdivbrdivdivA lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy As long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town Id recommend looking into this option because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answersdiv

Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, First be aware that each end every one of us has anxiety at some point That certainly seems to fit what youre describing here but that doesnt mean you have an anxiety disorder necessarily Thats where there is a difference Anyone who has a hard time with public speaking or feels uncomfortable in large crowds for example is experiencing anxiety  It sounds like it would be helpful to look at the differences between the days when you are more comfortable on the days that you are not If you notice your anxiety is keeping you from doing things that you need or want to do it may be helpful to talk with and mental health professional  I wonder also whether your appetite and sleeping patterns are the same or similar to how they were before you experienced this anxiety when your anxiety started and whether you feel more comfortable when someone you trust is there with you  If you have an idea of times or situations in which you feel anxious consider carrying a small smooth rock or another object that makes you feel calm and centered Perhaps you can keep it in your pocket and remember specific comfortable times while you have it in your hand

Im a man and Im soon to be married I have been messing around with other men on the side It started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot I dont know what to do, If you are happy with the person that you are about to be married to and are also enjoying time with other men it could be possible that you are attracted to people of more than one gender  Having said that some people have feelings toward people of more than one gender that are not really related to romance or attraction but any number of other feelings such as trust and communication I dont know whether your use of the phrase messing around was related specifically to being romantically or sexually involved with the people who you are or referring to or if you are saying that you are enjoying spending time with them These terms have different definitions for almost everyone  I would definitely recommend speaking with a local mental health practitioner in your area not because there is anything wrong about the way you are feeling but because there are a lot of different parts of what is happening in your life right now and it may be helpful to talk about the feelings and thoughts with someone who can help you to learn more about yourself and the people are most important in your life yourself included  I also suggest looking at a few things that you love and appreciate about yourself 
He wants to wear makeup and heels He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him I have tried this for him but I dont like it and have told him so He keeps making comments about it and says he cant live without it, It sounds like you may be asking two different questions  With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this If you choose to do that I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience This can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when Questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understoodnbsp  span stylelineheight 142857Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over timespanbr  You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having  As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you dont like andor understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here It depends on what you both prefer  These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially Having structured conversations such as the ones Ive described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument  Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas 
Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, Your sitting in your car for 30 minutes story sounds so sad and frustrating  Yes youre describing classic symptoms of anxiety  Anxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightened  Are you able to recall from your growing up years of feeling insecure  You may not have felt loved and nurtured as much as you needed  Some people develop anxiety from missing enough love nbspThey feel lacking in ability to take care of themselves similar to the lack of being sufficiently taken care of when younger  Try understanding if you felt neglected emotionally  If yes then start the slow process of emotionally rewarding and acknowledging yourself  Progress will be slow  Eventually youll stabilize the way you feel toward yourself  This will gradually result in decreased anxiety  br 
I have known I was always different This year in December I found out that I never felt female I did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad, I admire your courage  If you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity I would suggest a couple of things There are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now I dont mean to convey that everyone thinks feels or acts the same by any means but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiences  I was trying to include some links for you but that particular button isnt functioning window If you search for transgender support on Google youll find GLAAD and PFLAG both of which are national organizations This does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources  As far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support This may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him  One thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation That way you have greater chances of having the persons attention andor not needing to end the conversation quicklynbsp  Also please remember that you know yourself best as each of us does 
Im a girl and I cant tell whether Im bisexual or gay I like girls a little more than boys but I dont really know, Sexual orientation is not always something that is clearly definable Some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end only girls is at the other and bisexual is in the middle Anywhere in between those points can be any amount of attraction to boys or girls  If you dont know whether you are gay or bisexual that is okay A lot of people dont know for quite some time In addition to that after people do know who they are attracted to a lot of times they do not use the terms gay or bisexual for quite a while  Its okay not to know  Think about what sorts of expectations you have for your ideal relationship Some examples may include trust respect availability for conversation or connection etc Whatever it is that you find important in a relationship is likely what matters most  If you are struggling with learning what it is that you would like in a relationship or any other feelings connected with what you are thinking and feeling I would suggest connecting with a local therapist so you have a place to talk about what you are experiencing 
I went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide When I went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that I put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders He was very angry that I went to him to do that Am I in the wrong for going to him to reach out He helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why I thought of him to reach out He made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help Why did he react this way towards me I think hes being selfish, Im glad you think so highly of your boyfriend and his ability to be there when you would like to talk about things that are important to you  I see why you would want them to reach out I also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out It sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friends wellbeing although I cant say that for certain  Would you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes five minutes or so you ask him about what made him react that way During this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience You can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does This does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow I hear you saying that you think hes being selfish Im suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling In one sentence the goal would be to learn more about his experience  I would not be at all surprised if he is scared  Are you aware of what kind of support he wants through this time

I have terrible anxiety and depression Ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped, Is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked nbsp If this is possible interview a therapist before nbspstarting therapy nbsp Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life  Also therapy isnt for everyone  Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better  What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective 
Ive been dealing with this for years My mom thinks Im overly emotional and refuses to offer any help like therapy or seeing a doctor Shes seen me when Im having a panic attack and just said I was faking for attention or that Im a hypochondriac I just want to get better, How old are you  Are you old enough in your State to have therapy without your mothers consent  Your moms attitude toward you may be one significant reason on why you feels so much tension in the first place  Dont let her opinions and beliefs get in the way of what you know about yourself  Are you in school and does that school have a guidance counselor  Would you talk with that person about your difficult getting your mom to retain helping services for you  Keep looking for local resources which will support you either directly or indirectly by advocating for your right to receive mental health care 
These jokes are made about everything They seem to have the need to say something funny about everything Its not funny just awkward, I agree it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all nbspAnd if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tedious  Realize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression nbsp  You could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave  br 
Im in my early 20s Ive worked since two months after I turned 18 I have plans I could become an electrician or I could operate heavy machinery I have goals but I do nothing to try to meet them because I dont feel I can I just want a better life for my fiance and the kids than I did, For starters commend yourself for being committed to working You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story nbspRemind yourself of that every time the thought pops up nbspThe false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams Next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator If not find out Then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps As you accomplish each step see your progress nbspNotice that you are moving closer to your goal nbspEvery day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career nbspIn fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror nbspWhen you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out Anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work Stay with it You and your family are worth it 
My husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in November She invited him to dinner alone with their daughter I wasnt aware of this until after 11pm when I asked where he was He had been drinking and I told him not to come home that night The next morning we talked about going to counseling He went out that night with friends and said his exwife wasnt going I found out in April that she did go I gave him the chance to get everything out in the open I found out that he stayed that second night with her I asked if they slept in the same bed and he said yes both nights His daughter wasnt there the second night He claims they didnt have sex but what else should I think,My answer is going to be super simplistic but I believe this may be what you need Ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you nbspIf he says yes then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional nbspIf he says no then you can file for divorce nbsp
I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs His coworker sent him an inappropriate video He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that, In my book this is a boundary issue Although you do not like inappropriate content it is not up to you what your childs father looks at or what his friend sends him nbspIt is really hard not to monitor other peoples lives but in the end your rights begin and end with you 
Im a man and Im soon to be married I have been messing around with other men on the side It started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot I dont know what to do, Divorce is expensive emotionally and financially If your fiance is not ok with an open marriage it would be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor before you get married 
I told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again She started crying because I wouldnt make her daddy die, Its normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm I think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious 
Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, Though I dont know for sure it sounds like anxiety to me I think it would be helpful if you work with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disordersnbsp 
I have terrible anxiety and depression Ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped, Im sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much relief  I will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpful  I would encourage you to continue trying different therapists I would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you Also most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping If something is or is not working communicate this with your therapist This is a big deal Most therapists I know actually welcome this feedback  There is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important Also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis If that is something with which you are struggling I would encourage you to talk about that as well  In addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation Mindfulness is sometimes helpful as well  Heres a link to questions for finding suitable therapistsnbsphttpwwwpharmatherapistcom12tipsforfindingasuitabletherapist

Ive been with a man for four years For the last year he has said he is done but he still talks texts visits and has not moved on with anyone else His words do not match his actions I love this man but its hurting so much, This can be difficult and confusing  If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion When that time matches with a time that is good for you try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there He may want to be really good friends He may also be trying to figure out what he is feelingnbsp  If you end up talking over one another try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience Then you can switch Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but lead to more explanations  Questions that start with the words how what when who are usually better than questions starting with why because they can be emotional triggers for some people  If this is difficult to do between the two of you consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples 
My doctor seems to think I am in danger of having one I neglected to ask how this was different than an episode I have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type 1, I will admit that Im not specifically familiar with this from my own experience  My best educated guess is that you could have a seizure during which you have some sort of symptoms similar to a hallucination which is one of the psychotic symptoms when you hear or see things that arent really there  In looking briefly online I was able to find some information herenbsphttpwwwepilepsycominformationprofessionalsaboutepilepsyseizurespsychiatricandbehavioralaspectspsychiatric2  It sounds like this would be a symptom in addition to an already existing seizure disorder not a seizure disorder in addition to a mental health problem If it is the other way around Im not sure how that would work It is common with some types of seizures to have an altered state of reality during or shortly after the seizure so that could also be related  I would suggest you talk to your physician about this directly so that if they are worried about this you can learn more about what is making them concerned about it and what if anything you could do to lessen the likelihood of it or how to handle it if it does happen 
Ive been with a man for four years For the last year he has said he is done but he still talks texts visits and has not moved on with anyone else His words do not match his actions I love this man but its hurting so much, Have you brought up the topic as to the way youre feeling  The best way for someone to understand us or to understand someone is to directly talk about nbspthe specific problem  To start the discussion w your partner understand your own reasons for continuing the relationship  span stylewebkittextsizeadjust 100Given his stated disinterest in the relationship your mood is probably affected by thisspan  span stylewebkittextsizeadjust 100Once you are clear on how the range of your feelings especially any fears on being alone suggesting you may be staying w this guy simply to avoid such fears then youll be ready w your selfknowledge to start a conversation w your partner about your relationshipnbspspanbr 
We had great chemistry but then he became distant I had the feeling that I cant be without him As soon as I felt the difference I was scared to lose him I started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened, The simplest answer is that love feels good obsessions dont  Love deepens a sense of peacefulness and security  Obsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandoned  One suggestion is to study more about yourself and why youd feel so ill at ease when you arent w this person 
We had great chemistry but then he became distant I had the feeling that I cant be without him As soon as I felt the difference I was scared to lose him I started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened, People often care deeply for those whom they love I dont know how long you have been together It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you  It may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you For example maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he can  Sometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy you have the ability to write a message and he has the ability to answer when he can  I also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened I dont know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your life  Some people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry but this is difficult for others  I would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved valued appreciated or special  Also think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argument  It may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelming  Perhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person Remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another 
I shake and have panic attacks, One of the first things I would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxiousnbsp  If you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician Sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroid  One of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety particularly panic attacks can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks Also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brains protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat You may have heard of the fight or flight response When you have an anxiety attack your body is preparing you to react to something that isnt actually a threat so its almost as if youre fight or flight response is overactive Here is an image that may be helpfulnbsphttppsychologytoolsfightorflightresponsehtml  There are many different things you can do You can practice breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga techniques If you decide to try some breathing techniques try breathing in for a count of five holding for a count of five breathing out for a count of five and repeating five times  Also remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when youre not having a panic attack At that point it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic Also remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes Using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxious  Here are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxietynbsphttppsychcentralcomlib9waystoreduceanxietyrighthererightnow  As you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you Another important question could be when you have felt that way before 
I just dont know what I want in life anymore Im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused I cant put things into perspective at all Im just stuck and Im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments, It sounds as if you would benefit from talking with a local mental health professionals so you can discuss some details  Having said that I wonder if you could consider how you would define yourself to someone who doesnt know you For example honest adaptable funloving dependable compassionate openminded dedicated etc If youre looking for a list of adjectives try thesenbsphttpswwwenglishclubcomvocabularyadjectivespersonalitypositivehtm  There is a list of negative ones here too If youre going to use those try to use three positive ones for each of the negative ones You could also try asking yourself what you love about yourself andor what others love about you Sometimes its easier to consider what others see as our positive points and if this is difficult for you try asking someone who you trust to help you with the list  The idea here is to look at your relationship with yourself I dont mean this in a way that you would be talking to yourself and receiving answers but rather looking at yourself in a way that you deserve the same kind of loving and compassion that you give to others or want others to have  Im also curious as to whether you are eating and sleeping okay as these things can really affect your focus and many other changes such as differences in your emotions Also you saying that you are struggling to put things into perspective leads me to believe that you are going through some things right now that are not typical for you if so consider from whom you have support and the ability to talk about what you are going through  Consider Metta meditation here to help give yourself loving kindnessnbsphttpwwwmettainstituteorgmettameditationhtml 
There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home I have food clothes and a university education but I never feel like I belong Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close I feel like Im just out with friends and I never go home, For some people having a sense of belonging takes some time  You mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs I wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment If you have those feelings I wonder how you define trust and who you trust  You say you have a good time with people who are supposed to be close so I wonder what keeps them from feeling close I have also wondering if you have been emotionally hurt in the past and if so you may have some protective defenses that you use maybe on purpose maybe not to protect yourself from being hurt again Remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others Being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situations  I also wonder what it is that you want in your home and how you define it Consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions such as money or location After you have that consider what parts of that you can have Perhaps there is a small part that you could make a reality within a week or so  Thank you for reaching out If this continues to be difficult for you consider seeing a local mental health professional so you can discuss some more specific details 
Im in my mid 20s with a husband and children I love my family but I feel like Ive lost my identity and I dont know who I am other than a mom and wife At times all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped but I know Id feel like worse without them I loathe myself at times I have an amazing life so why cant I just enjoy it, It sound like there are some parts of your life that you really enjoy it and also some things that you wish were different  You say you feel like nothing more than a wife and mom so I wonder if you could make a list of what else you are friend daughter etc I also wonder if you could list your positive attributes or skills  I dont know what you gave up but I wonder if there is some way that you could spend an hour or so a week working on things that you like andor spending some time with what you did before you had children For example if youre missing a certain part of your career maybe you could work with your husband to come up with a plan where you could do whenever that is for one day a week There are often a lot of small changes that can lead you in that direction  Of course that is assuming that you want to continue being involved with what you were doing before nbspIf not what else do you want to do What is it that makes you feel happy What do you look forward to Remember that looking forward to having an hour or two where you can do something for yourself does not mean that you are not a good mother or wife These ideas can coexist  Can you talk with your husband about how you are feeling Do you have trust for one another with feelings such as these

My boyfriend has this close female friend It always bothered me because of how close they are so I decided to meet her That made the situation worse because they were even closer than what I thought They acted like a couple rather than friends with each other There was no physical interaction but he talks to this girl a lot What can I do Leaving him isnt an option, I wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling A few things may help with that ulliTry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important for example not during a commercial for a TV showliliMaybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience kind of like an investigative reporter wouldliliSee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youliliRemember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesliliAlso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesliliThen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example what it is that he likes about herliliAlso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between 15 minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionliliRemember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to find a solution right awayliul This can be difficult Consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together 
She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong For once I want her to be proud of me Its like no matter what I do she does not have one nice word to say to me She is always hateful towards me and always has been, I imagine this is very difficult and confusing for you  It sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself which is really good I hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that youre doing  If you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have The reason Im suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselves  If you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you If youre going to have a conversation like that I would suggest you try these things ulliAsk her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation If she says no consider asking her when would be a better timeliliTry to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this If you can ask questions to learn more about that you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feelingliliThis doesnt mean that you have to agree with her but just that you are able to hear where she is coming fromliliTry to ask questions that start with the words who what how where when Questions that start with the word why can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotionliliTry to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it rightliliIf you want your mom to know how you feel after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to sayliliIf youre going to tell your mom about how you feel consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want toliliIt will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away I know I would be wanting to jump right into the conversation Remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming fromliliAlso if she says she doesnt want to have a conversation remember that she has that choiceliul If your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you remember that you could go on your own Depending on your state and exactly how old you are you may need your parents permission to be in treatment but not always If you need help to figure that out try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone 
He was in love with someone years ago and he still thinks about her time to time He said and I quote That relationship is definitely over I love you but that girl will always be in my mind It just didnt feel like he appreciated all the things Ive done to make him happy, It sounds like you were in a tough spot here  Im not able to tell you whether or not you made a mistake because the decision is yours I am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy If so is it an option to talk about this with him  If you decide to get back together consider having some conversations about what your concerns are and taking about five minutes or so to listen to this guys thoughts feelings etc Then see if you can repeat the essence of what he said to make sure you have it right Then maybe you can ask some questions that you have and see if he is willing to listen When each of you is in the role of asking questions try to ask them as if you are an investigative reporter trying to learn more about each others experience  If you are looking for information on coping with breaking up and you dont want to get back together or thats not an option consider looking at how you define yourself and what is most important to you at this moment I hear you saying youve done a lot of things to make him happy Im wondering what is making you happy Hopefully you have friends or family that you can trust and talk to Even if you dont talk about your relationship with all of them I hope you have some people around whom you can be emotionally safe and comfortable

Ive been with a man for four years For the last year he has said he is done but he still talks texts visits and has not moved on with anyone else His words do not match his actions I love this man but its hurting so much, That does sound very confusingand hurtfulnbsp You do not have to tolerate someone treating you in a way that hurts younbsp It may be helpful to decide where the boundaries are for you and to stay true to them in your interactions with himnbsp You teach other people how they are allowed to treat you  br 
Im a man and Im soon to be married I have been messing around with other men on the side It started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot I dont know what to do, I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner Such asnbspis itnbspmore exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationshipbr 
Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way did you eat and what what time of day is it how much sleep did you get that night etc This can help you identify any triggers Further assessment can be made by a health care professional It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxietybr 
When my son was a teenager we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude A week after he graduated his dad made him leave because of the same issues All four parents tried to talk to him and he just refuses help all around He is now living with his grandparents He had a job and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle I thought he was heading down the right road and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it I just dont know what to do, I admire your efforts You can continue to offer assistance for your son but it is ultimately up to him to decide what to do with the information or ideas that you are giving to him  One thing you might try is to ask questions in a way that enables you to learn more about what he is experiencing For example if he is willing to talk to you about what he does on a daily basis andor what he would like to be doing you may be able to get a sense of what he finds difficult and find some resources to help  I might ask things like this just as examples ulliCan we talk for a few minutes about some things that I would like to learn more aboutliliIm just looking to learn more about what has been happening for you recently and Im not trying to make you do anythingliliI know you said you quit your job because you didnt like it Could you tell me more about what you liked and what you didnt likeliliDo you see yourself doing the same kind of job in the futureliliWhat is it that makes you happy or what is it that you look forward to doingliliCan you think of anything that I can do to be of support to youliul If he is interested you may be able to connect him with an area community college to learn more about possible job opportunities  With the way that I wrote the questions above it probably sounds like its relatively easy In reality it may not be an easy conversation and your son may choose not to discuss it with you If thats the case Id remind yourself that you are trying to do everything you can 
In middle school and high school my friends and family thought I was gay I tried telling them but they wouldnt believe me It almost feels like they wanted me to be Now Im actually starting to believe them I know I wasnt back then and now Im not sure anymore, I agree with Amy We get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we wantnbspat a pretty early age The truth is our sexuality cannbspchange and grow in directions we never imagined   I may be wrong but I am getting the impression that you may not iwanti to be gay That this is something you didnt like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true Thisnbspwould certainly benbspunderstandable Your sexuality is YOURS and yours alone It can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are And it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself   The truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation It may help to think about what iqualities iyou find attractive What kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to Someone smart Funny Loves dogs If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not At least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire   Another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested Preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy   br  Be well and be you  br  Robinnbsp J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC  br  br  br 
I was the one who ended it and Im so glad I did It was the best decision I made in my life But how do I stop the nightmares and flashbacks It is creating a wall in my current relationship, One thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now If you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you Tried to stay grounded andor mindful That is being aware of your position in the room your feet on the floor your hands in your lap or your hips in the chair Being mindful of the environment you are currently for example noticing what is around you may be helpful Try to use all your senses For example you could focus on hearing your husbands voice feeling his hand in yours being wrapped in your favorite blanket seeing a comforting photo using a comforting sense or candle or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchen  It also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma I would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professional  Remember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship Our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again This is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all 
I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake It was totally my fault but due to another insurance issue I left a note with an illegible phone number Guilty over this I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars Unfortunately by the time I returned the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away Since I cannot make this up to that individual how do I atone for my cowardly act I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out, nbsp nbspThanks for sharing as it shows your humanity and that you have a sensitive conscience In your example here Id encourage you to always think safety first and never offer a stranger at the accident scene several hundred dollars Why Because it could go badly against you ie extortion robbed or would this be considered a bribe  nbsp nbspTo the point Im reminded of Steps Eight and Nine in many 12step programs regarding making amends In your specific example since the injured unidentified party departed and by your own admission youve been doing random acts of kindness it seems to me youve acted in reasonable good faith fashion to make amends Well done  nbsp nbspIm not a karma expert but as a therapist I would invite you to explore the deeper story behind your use of the words cowardly guilty and what it does for you to engage in random acts of kindness What a fascinating journey this could be for you Best wishes 
I dont know what to say I have never really known who I am, This is perhaps the deepest question that one can ask of themselves and the answer is as elusive as the deepest enigma We are fluid beings we are never the same from day to day we learn or unlearn we evolve or some of us even devolve we are in a state of constant flux changing and adapting like a cloud in the sky that has its shape changed by the wind life whittles us away and carves us constantly trying to understand this question is like trying to bite your own teeth however we can have a sense of what we would call our core and to understand the core we need to live and to experience but also to think deeply analytically and critically by engaging with life we get a sense that we are like the Earth itself inside of us there is a core just as there is inside our planet but our continents shift and change over time like those continents so does our own nature shift throughout our livesnbsp br 
Ive become so jaded that I cant control my thoughts I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks, I imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourself  When you said that you are jaded Im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereof  One of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack Consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some way  As far as finding yourself you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered You could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortable  You may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you what it is that you are living by now and what values you would prefer to live bynbsphttpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarification  If this proves to be difficult consider seeing a local therapist 
My husband and I have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times Others have told me that most men would have left me by now Honestly I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing I want to be better connected with my husband, There are a lot of different things that could be playing a role here  First different people have unique levels of sex drive and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalance  Because you say both that there is a possibility that neither one of you actually knows what youre doing and you want to be better connected with your husband consider having some time where you sit together and touch each other in nonsexual ways and communicate about what you like and dont like One person would be doing the touching and the other would be communicating Then the rules would switch After you both become comfortable with that you could try the same thing with touching that is sexual in nature  Dr Tammy Nelson is a therapist who specializes in relationships and sexual issues and she has several books and lots of other resources on her websitenbsphttpswwwdrtammynelsoncom  There are actually therapists who specialize in sex therapy and if you are interested in that you would want a therapist who is a CSAT certified sex addiction therapist This does not mean that they only specialize in sexual addiction but they do have special training in discussing sexual elements of relationships and their training is quite extensive  In addition to connecting sexually you may consider discussing with your husband whether each of you are aware of things that make you feel valued special loved and appreciated It may be that making positive changes related to your sex life would also improve your relationship and vice versa 
I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor They wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog I have the paper work and I gave it to my apartment manager They said I cant keep the ESD because Im not disabled What do you suggest I do, This is tricky because there are different types of emotional support dogs The ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasks  You may benefit from looking at the blog written by Valerie Parrott who has an emotional support dog due to severe anxiety and panic I will warn you that her blog is very blunt but she is honest and she has gone through this processnbsphttpsthedogintheroomwordpresscom20160620whatmakesaservicedogmore508 
I dont know what to say I have never really known who I am, Because you put this under the category of spirituality Im not sure whether you are asking how you find yourself as far as religious or spiritual beliefs or overall  If you are talking about learning more about religious or spirituality consider either going to or speaking with someone who is involved with a nondenominational church service the Salvation Army usually has something so you can discuss questions or ideas that you may have  As far as finding yourself in general I suggest considering what makes you happy andor comfortable I also wonder if looking at the list of values here may be helpful to younbsphttpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarification 
My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned She calls me every day complaining but I dont want to hear it anymore, This sounds stressful  You mentioned that you want to learn how to avoid them Im not sure whether you want to avoid them overall or if you would like to ask your mom to maybe only talk to you about it for a few minutes about your niece in each conversation that you have  Maybe you can connect your mom with some support It sounds as if she has lost part of herself andor is very stressed out and in talking with you about it because she trusts you enough for you to be someone she can speak openly you are becoming stressed because of things that you cannot directly change This is the presumptive based on the amount of information that you posted but it sounds like there is a bit of a circle of stress here  I also wonder who you could talk with when you are stressed  It may be helpful to see a local mental health professional to help redefine some boundaries so you can have the type of relationship with your mother that you want without necessarily feeling stressed out by it every day 
My fianc and I recently had an argument over finances He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy He realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why I was allowing him to continue to do that since I was physically paying it for him My response was that he was giving me the money and I just made the payment I didnt think of the coverages He was angry about it I still cant figure out that anger, A few things come to mind I wonder if your fianc is still angry about it or if he was angry in that moment and has now worked through it  It sounds like there was also a difference in expectations here You were just nbsppaying the bill with the money he was giving to you and he may have assumed you were reading it You thought that you were following his directions It could be that you could have a discussion about it but that depends on how much of a hot button issue it still is for either of you  If youre going to talk about it I might suggest asking whether this would be a good time to have a discussion about what happened with the automobile insurance so that you can both use the opportunity to learn more about yourselves and each other around this particular issue 
She said she needed space after three days of dating and she got a boyfriend a week later I still really miss her and she told me she still likes me, It sounds as if your exgirlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you There are lots of levels of relationships from a basic acquaintance to a more friendly acquaintance to a friend close friend best friend early romantic partner committed romantic partner and many more  If she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called openended questions which ask her to provide more information During this process it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective After you have done this for five minutes its a rough estimate but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling The goal is not necessarily to change the outcome but to learn more about yourselves and each other  Then you may have an idea of where you stand in each others eyes 
I recently went through a divorce My exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me My sister never defended me Now that I showed the truth shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight Why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning, Unfortunately I cant tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that way  I can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved While the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics Also a lot of people dont act the same way around extended family or other people as they do at home behind closed doors so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in it  I wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister how she is treating you how you feel around her now etc I do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship you could find a time when you could ask about this why she didnt convey that to him from the beginning in a way that is calm not defensive and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister not looking to defend yourself at that moment If that conversation can happen it may be quite a difficult one so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation its not about you but is about where she was coming from After you think you understand that Im saying that you understand where shes coming from not that you agree with what shes saying you could see if shes willing to listen to how you feel about it 
Ive known him for about six years Weve dated off and on I hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again I really want this to last this time I stayed the night Do I text call or make contact first the same day of the morning I left his house, I dont see why you cant call text or make contact first It would be up to him to reply when he can and wants to but I dont know why you couldnt initiate contact  One thing to consider as you get to know each other better is having conversations about conversations For example you could say Id like to call or text you more often but Im concerned about  listing what you are most worried about Then he can discuss his reaction and you can have a dialogue about it 
Im a teenager and while Ive never been to any kind of therapist I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house I cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own and when I do I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time I also forget things a lot, With the way you described your anxiety it sounds like you have different types of anxiety Im not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone nbspsometimes called separation anxiety or some combination thereof  One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are on a scale of 1 to 10 in different situations Also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns  As for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious When you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode Its also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related  Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort  Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes  Also if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well For example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself Im anxious right now and Im okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you  Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own which is very common consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas  Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable 
My fianc and I broke up He cheated on me numerous times I kept forgiving but questioning his every move He got tired and left, There is a grieving process after losing a relationship or any other major loss such as a job a house etc One of the things to consider is give yourself a chance to go through the tasks of mourning olliTo accept the reality of the lossliliTo process the pain of griefliliTo adjust to a world without the person who has just leftliliTo find an enduring connection with that person in the midst of embarking on a new life This could mean a lot of things but it could be holding certain memories as your ownliol You may also find things that make you feel happy or comfortable Its also helpful to have people who you can talk to about your feelings and people who may be able to recognize things about you that you cannot see right now such as how you are honest committed to your work a good listener etc  This takes some time Try to be gentle with yourself 
My spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago Things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house He says he despises the sight of me wants to be with other women and divorce What I dont understand is that he says constantly that I have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if I speak to another male Why does he constantly do these behaviors I might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist, It sounds like this is quite difficult  It sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life which could be a part of where the jealousy comes from and sometimes he doesnt Talking about this would likely be a delicate conversation and from what you mention he has been diagnosed with Im wondering if he has a therapist If so do you know whether he would allow you to come to one session so you can learn more about how he feels Maybe he would be to use more of it because in the contained environment of an therapy office This way at least you would know where hes coming from You could also ask whether he is able to hear what you want wish for or desire between the two of you  Remember just because you hear or follow what he is saying does not imply that you agree with him although that concept in itself could be a subject of discussion because not everyone is aware of it  I hope that you are able to hold onto who you are and what you want throughout this 
Every time my partner gets angry for anything she takes it out on me Nothing I do is right and once shes mad she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive She says it isnt abuse its just angry verbal bashing and that its different It gets worse each time The names are very vulgar now, One thing you could try is to talk to your partner when shes not angry about the following ulliIf shes angry maybe she can talk with you about what she is angry about rather than calling you namesliliIf she gets angry and then calms down a little while later maybe one of you can take a timeout in the discussion and set a time when you will come back to itliliDiscuss what it is that you find acceptable for you to do during an argumentliliDiscuss what it is that you find unacceptable for you to do during an argumentliliDiscuss what is acceptable for her to do during an argumentliliDiscuss what is on acceptable for her to do during an argumentliliYour partner can answer the same questions related to herself and youliul I cant emphasize enough how important it is to have this discussion when there is not an argument going on Perhaps you could mention that you would like to talk about something that is really important and see if the current time is a good time If not consider when in the next 24 to 48 hours would be a good time  It may also be helpful to discuss these ideas with a local therapist The therapist may also be able to help both of you figure out where the anger is coming from and where she has learned to react this way  If it is abuse it may be even more difficult to have these important discussions It may be helpful for you to see a local therapist by yourself to assess things like physical and emotional safetyspan stylelineheight 142857span 
Ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me Now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and I dont know how to process this Its bothering both of us, This can be really anxietyproducing when you have not felt it before It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas  Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you  I would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you Perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that You could even remind yourself okay Im here with name of girlfriend and this is okay when Im with her  We all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people Its common for people to see these things as black and white either totally open or very selfprotective In reality its much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light its not really Just red orange yellow green blue indigo violet that we all know but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next You can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in the mood you are both in the subject etc There are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment  Another thing that could help is to communicate about communication If one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable you could discuss that If she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable you could discuss that as well  Hopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time 
Shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family We dont talk much because of it Also we have little fights We want to work it out but we dont know how, Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other even if it needs to be on the phone Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you  As far as your little fights consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended cannot be answered with just yes or no and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing Then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch Its also good to restate what you think you are hearing Then you know what each other is truly following about this Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from  Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated Think of the same for your girlfriend This could be a great discussion to have as well 
She has lied about every aspect of her life Shes created three fake relationships The most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos phone calls and text messages and its with a married man with kids Her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives, span stylelineheight 20pxTo be honest I think more information would be really important here because what you are asking could have a lot of different meanings Consider making an appointment with a local therapist to discuss what you are going throughspan 
I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it  I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call  I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive I know what Im doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change How do I stop this behavior and thought process, span stylelineheight 142857Here are some things Im wonderingspanbr ulliDo you have close friends that you can talk to trust and who can be around sometimes when youre in between relationshipsliliWhat do you like about yourself What are your strongest pointsliliDo you think you have been in relationships with controlling than in the past because it makes you feel as though you are worth something to themliliWhat kind of relationship you want to be inliliWhat are the top three or four attributes of the type of partner you wantliliWhat can you do to make yourself emotionally safe during your typical daily activitiesliliCan you notice a list of things that you can control throughout a typical day For example you probably choose what to wear what to eat how to talk to others how committed you are to school or work etcliul It also sounds as if it may be helpful to discover more about yourself in addition to what you look for in a partner  As far as emotional abuse it may be useful to develop communication skills that you could use prior to their relationship progressing to the point that it is emotional abuse  Thank you for reaching out to ask questions If the questions that Ive asked here are difficult for you to answer or are overwhelming talking with a local therapist would probably be something I would suggest 
Im a teenager and I know the importance of my upcoming schooling However no matter how much I put in my best effort my family thinks I have done zero effort in total What can I do, First of all Im glad that you posted here and Im glad that you recognize the importance of schooling  Where does your family get the idea that you are not putting in the effort While people can interpret effort differently with talking about schoolwork I would think that your grades would show the effort that you are putting in  If you are getting good grades and you are saying that your family does not think your grades are good enough maybe there could be a conversation where you are able to ask them what they are expecting from you and try to listen without defending yourself for a few minutes and then you could explain what you are doing to prepare Maybe you could set time limits so you each have five minutes to discuss this or less if you think that would be better  If your grades are not as good as you would like and you are putting in the effort I would still consider having a conversation like I mentioned above and perhaps taking advantage of tutoring or other possibilities offered by your school  Just as a bit more information for you I have been working with children teenagers and adults for more than nine years now When someone tells me that they wish their child would do better in school I always ask what that means Sometimes it means that their grades are Ds and Fs For other families it means that the grades dropped below 95 and in that family that is unacceptable Perception makes a big difference here  If you are doing your best and accomplishing your goals that is worth celebrating 
Im trying to make marriage work after a split Before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me I dont think he cheated Last month I asked what women work with him so he told me Yesterday I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about Should I be upset, Imagine your best friend just told you that her husband lied to her all the time and that he had broken every promise he ever made to her What would you tell her If I were her best friend Id tell her to run the other waynbsp  You may love this man We dont choose who we love But the evidence is pretty clear isnt itnbsp  A healthy relationship cannot be built on a foundation of lies and broken promises I believe that as adults we are always treated as well as we insist on being treated by our partners If you continue to accept unacceptable behavior you are likely to see lots more of itnbsp 
I dont know what to say I have never really known who I am, The older I get the more I believe that our real task isnt to find ourselves Were already 100 there What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive most happy most creative and most fully engaged with life It is in those moments that we find ourselves  For example I couldnt help loving the people or things I loved no matter who tried to talk me out of them All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alivenot because I was afraid or addicted but because in those moments I was in contact with my highest selfnbsp  On the flip side I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in methe ones that made me feel controlled constricted dishonest resentful or afraidand be honest about themnbsp  Mindfulness of what already is is the key to finding yourself Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you Dont let old habits crappy jobs or meanspirited people define you Just stumble your way forward as best you can with greater selfawareness followed by affirmative action nbspnbsp 
My best friend and I were pranking her friend and I told her to tell him that she likes him She said no but I forced her After she told him he told her that he likes her too Their friendship is ruined because of me She wont forgive me and I feel really guilty I feel like crying, This takes time I dont know how long it has been but perhaps if your friend is willing to discuss other things with you for a little while you could discuss this at some point in the future  Hopefully the true intentions will become apparent in the idea that it was a prank  Also I encourage you to look at how this is affecting you and how you feel about yourself as well If it was meant to be a joke and it did not work that is not entirely your fault  I wonder how you could forgive yourself for what happened ulliAre you able to seek what you meant to do compared to what actually happenedliliDo you notice that not everything that has happened here is in your controlliliDo you recognize that even though you would like things to be better if your friend is not ready or willing you are trying to do your part to make it rightliliMaybe everyone who iswas involved in this can talk together all at the same time to set straight what is truth and what was misunderstoodliliI wonder if you can think of your own positive attributes for example honesty compassion trustworthiness friendship good listener caring and look at what truly exists within you rather than just one your friend is able to see right nowliul This can be really difficult for multiple reasons not the least of which is that it involves more than just you so its important to focus on the idea that you can ask these other people who were involved to discuss it but that is ultimately up to them  Best wishes for looking at the positive parts of yourself and your friendships 
My older brother in his 60s started dating a lady with Aspergers She is hypersexual and flirty She does not understand boundaries Theyve been dating for a few months and shes talking marriage Another sibling and his wife have met her and they have said she is never invited back My brother always picks similar ladies Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship, This is tricky and quite delicate  I wonder if you could talk with your brother about whether he would be willing to have a discussion with you about something that is important to you I would also suggest trying to make clear your true intentions For example ulliTelling him that he has the right to do what he wants with who he chooses to dateliliThat you are talking to him about this because you care about himliliThat your relationship with him is important to you and that you love him and care about himliliAlso try to stick to examples or ideas that are objectively observable for example when this happens  I notice  That way you are using facts rather than opinions and things that can be observed rather than subjective emotional decisionsliliI would also be curious with what your brother sees in this girl and I might even recommend starting with thatliul I cannot underline enough the importance of having this come across as genuine and for lack of a better word gentle  I also be very honest with you that I cannot guarantee that he will react positively neutrally or even that he will have the discussion with you  Because it is true that he could choose to continue dating this girl and perhaps even hold it against you for a while I would also encourage you to look at the importance of this to you and where you consider the riskbenefit ratio to be 
I had to put a restraining order against my exfianc He was served last night He was mentally and verbally abusive towards me I thought it was my nerves but every time I stand up I get sick If I sit and rock Im fine, Hello and thank you for your question You may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomachnbspmay very well be your nerves or anxiety That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider They may tell you that they dont see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way   I work as a counselor in primary care and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common Sometimes with counseling those physical symptoms actually stop   Be well and I hope you feel better soon  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC   br  br  br  br

Im a teenage gay girl and Im in love with a girl a few years older than me She loves me too but were not physically together at the moment Ive been thinking about being transgender soon too but my family doesnt accept me so I honestly dont know what to do about that because I feel like I have to constantly hide the real me It hurts so much to hide the real me What can I do, They would probably be helpful to speak with a local mental health professional about this not because theres anything wrong with the real you but because having these conversations can be difficult and you may choose to talk about your real self in different ways with different people  Maybe you could talk about your concerns with your significant other and discuss different ways you may be able to discuss your relationship that fit with how each of you defines your love for one another  Because you are saying openly that you are gay and it sounds like you already identify yourself as gay as compared to considering being transgender soon it may be worth considering disclosing the fact that you are gay now and disclosing the idea that you are transgender after you have worked through that yourself I would like for you to be able to be true to yourself and show the real you It could also be that you already know that you are transgender but with the way that you nbspphrased it here Im not certain  Here is a link to a hotline that you may want to consider using The Trevor Project is about helping teenagers who identify as LGBTQnbsphttpwwwthetrevorprojectorg  Here is another national site where you may be able to find a local chapternbsphttpswwwpflagorg  I dont know what you mean when you said that your family will not accept you but since you are concerned about your familys reaction I would suggest that it may be helpful to have a therapist or some other support in place before telling your family The decision of whether or not to wait longer to tell them is ultimately yours but I wonder if you have a likelihood of explaining what you are experiencing in a way that would be truer to you and also perhaps easier for your family to follow if you had time to process it with supportive people first  Please remember that you are not alone in this There are people in the world who can and will accept you for who you are

Im trying to make marriage work after a split Before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me I dont think he cheated Last month I asked what women work with him so he told me Yesterday I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about Should I be upset, Is really difficult to tell whether he honestly forgot about someone or whether he was really lying again  I dont know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about it  This might be something to discuss with a local therapist so that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses are  This is difficult because I imagine you have a react very quickly and strongly to things like this because of what has happened in the past between you All of this make sense Having said that there is also a question of whether he is telling the truth in this particular case and your reaction is based on past events  Theres no easy way to know  If you do decide to have a discussion with your husband about it nbspconsider these things ulliAsk if this is a good time to have a conversation about something that is important to youliliMaybe you will be able to listen and ask questions about what came up for him emotionally when he realized that he didnt tell you about this other personliliMaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are thinking about if you are both able to do so without blaming pointing fingers or asking the other person to change This would just be an exchange of information Ideally this part of the competition would not be about you saying he did something wrong but just expressing how you felt when you heard about itliliIt may be helpful to discuss these things with a therapist first so you have some coping skills for being able to listen to him without being overly defensive and also expressing your feelings without blaming both of which would be very natural in this situationliul

I told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again She started crying because I wouldnt make her daddy die, Toddlers dont have the intellectual capacity to conceptualize  Better to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddler  A person must be around 9 possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present time  Pretty much your toddler demonstrated to you here age appropriate and limited understanding of the loss of a parent by crying that you werent able to magically make her father disappear  Also please pay attention and form your own opinions as to the reasons why your toddler would wish her fathers death  She may be pointing out that the father behaves in frightening or harmful ways towards her 
I dont know what to say I have never really known who I am, Start by giving yourself enough quiet and time to remember about yourself what feels steady and consistent in your nature and interactions with others  Give yourself the freedom to your interest in having interests nbspAre you motivated because of competing with others or because an activity itself feels satisfying  If you are able to develop a sense of defining yourself without fear of judging yourself you will start coming close to knowing who you are 
My husband and I have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times Others have told me that most men would have left me by now Honestly I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing I want to be better connected with my husband, The numbers you write are low compared to how much sex many other people would be satisfied having  The key is your and your husbands satisfaction with the amount of sex you are having  And know if there are reasons besides low sex drive that possibly explain this  Knowing the other possibilities matter because a low sex life may mean one of you is being satisfied sexually outside the marriage or that one of you prefers sex with a same gendered partner  If youve ruled out these possibilities and you are satisfied with your emotional and financial life in the relationship then a low sex drive may simply be the norm for the two of you 
My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned She calls me every day complaining but I dont want to hear it anymore, Then one day when life between you and mom feels calm tell your mom that you arent able to listen to her complaints about your sister  The truth exists whether or not it is acknowledged nbsp Bu acknowledging what feels real and necessary in your life you are helping your mom see what she may not like to see and what nevertheless is right in front of her  There is no good reason or good to come of hiding your own truth about not wishing to continue listening to your mom complain 
My fianc and I recently had an argument over finances He gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance He no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy He realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why I was allowing him to continue to do that since I was physically paying it for him My response was that he was giving me the money and I just made the payment I didnt think of the coverages He was angry about it I still cant figure out that anger, Id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per se  What you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilities  Start by withdrawing yourself from paying his bills  If he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himself  Stay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountable  Tell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you 
My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers The next day she kicked me out  She let me move back two days later Yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind I asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business, Divorce is a serious life altering decision  It is best to decide any serious matter through reflection and discussion  Start by knowing what you want from the marriage and why you are willing to move in or out of your own house because your wife tells you to do this  Each of you would benefit from more clarity of what you expect and would like from each other  Does your wife want a boyfriend in addition to the marriage to you  Is she willing to drop the male contact  Does she care how you feel about her contact with the other guy  You need answers and knowledge about the definition of your marriage  Since there are many areas to open all of which are filled with emotion including pain if youre not able to make satisfactory progress then a licensed couples therapist may be useful to you and your partner

I found the guy Im dating on dating websites He was telling women that they were beautiful He said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked It has since happened two other times He says he loves me and Im the only girl he wants to be with but I feel he is not telling me the truth, I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create For example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts You could also see what your boyfriend wants  You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking openended questions not being answered with yes or no and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right After that perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking openended questions  Remember that it takes two people to have nbspa relationship so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything I was very embarrassed, First of all congratulations to you on becoming a Water Safety Instructor  As far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject On the other hand it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class you wont see the same people much longer so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporary  As far as the class maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it wasnt intentional I think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted direction  Trying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful but it sounds like you are already doing that Something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when someone says something embarrassing about that occurrence such as it was an accident and I have fixed it now  You may find some helpful tips herenbsphttptinybuddhacomblogletgopastmistakes6stepsforgiving or herenbsphttppsychcentralcomlibhowdoyouforgiveyourself  These are not meant to be resources related to religion but it is mentioned in a few places 
I feel too scared to meet people I dont know  even relatives I dont ever raise my hand or talk in school I feel like no one understands How can I handle this, Congratulations on your courage to ask this question  This shows you are willing to engage with other people just not in all situations especially the in person ones  Start by meeting yourself  Reflect as thoroughly as possible as to what you imagine will be the outcome of meeting others or of speaking up during a class  Some people are afraid of being criticized or judged by other people or do this to themselves inwardly nbsp  If you are judging or criticizing yourself to be less worthy of having opinions or views or of being who you are than others then the thought of actually placing yourself in this situation would feel intolerable  One way to move out from this position of feeling less than others is to recognize that these feelings are inside of you  Then it is possible to know at least on an intellectual level that it is not true that any one person is superior to another  All the people whom you are afraid to meet also have their own insecurities  We are all equal in worth and in having blindspots about ourselves  Also it is possible that you are naturally shy and may be expecting more from yourself than is reasonable in terms of a standard about meeting others  You may have a few fears of being judged unfairly you may also simply not enjoy being around people very much  Be aware to not push yourself beyond your natural limits nbspOvercoming fears of being judged is different than forcing yourself to do what is against your basic nature 
Sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb I get furious  I even start throwing things Do I have a problem, Anyone who asks whether or not they have a problem usually feels at least partly that they do have a problem  Your answer to the question is what matters  Since you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them the reactions youre having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events either in the near or distant past  br  Be aware consider reflect on nbsphow you usually handle feeling angry nbsp  Based on your description here it is quite likely that the anger you show toward what you call little things reflect anger at much bigger matters that are uncomfortable and not easy to understand  Knowing more about the more significant matters causing frustration for you may very likely decrease reacting angrily toward smaller matters 
She mostly targets me on social media The bullying used to be much worse but it is still going on The comments are so vague but I know that they are meant for me Even when I confront her she messages me short phrases to try to get in my head If I try to fight back she will ruin me, Sorry to hear of your problem situation nbspFeeling intimidated by another person is very unsettling  Stop having contact with the person  Bullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someone  Bullies do not have the same dynamics as everyone else  No one can convince or persuade or talk a bully out of their behavior  The best protection for yourself assuming you are not being physically threatened by the person is to close contact with them  This does not take away any of the disappointment or sadness of wishing for a better relationship with the person  Until the bully wants to interact differently with others only harm can result from contact with them  Step one is to stop the bleeding then to assess and learn to live with not having the person in your life

When my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days When I ask what is wrong I get nothing no reply no phone call If he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes, This has to be very difficult to endure  Its pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict Very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait One thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like I cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hours  My best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood If he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is It could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that way  Something else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not These sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couples  As far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you You may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself For example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure

I am a peaceful person but I often find myself having thoughts about killing people Eventhough I like the thoughts at the time they make me cry Why do I feel like this, Hello and thank you for your question Clearly this is something that has you very concerned Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts and they are pretty harmlessnbspMany people have thoughts of killing someone but they would never actually do it They really dont even want to do it they are just having a thoughtnbspOther timesnbspthoughts are a sign of something more serious and we should receive help when they start to worry us I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement   Now If you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality you should call for help immediately By help I mean 911nbspor a family member or friend You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others Again none of this is to judge but rather to encourage you to get the help youre seeking   Either way when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior seeking counseling is usually a good choice   Be well   Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC  br

How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has Ive read about this online but Id like to understand this from a therapists point of view, Thats a great question There is such a wide range of ways to define personality that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality types  That being said some clinicians will use standardized tests or assessments to assess a clients type of personality While these tests cant tell us everything about a person they can help us understand where we are within larger groups of different personality styles  Some counselors will also use a diagnostic tool like the DSM or ICD to help a client understand a diagnosis that is related to a personality disorder 
What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation, This sounds like a potentially serious situation The most important thing is to make sure the child is safe nbspIf you suspect that a child is or has been harmed I would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to Child Protective Services If you dont think that a child is in danger you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board

How do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have  What characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has Ive read about this online but Id like to understand this from a therapists point of view, This is a great question and I am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach When I am determining what type of personality a client has I take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others Determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person and building rapport After taking time to get to know them and learning about their view they have of themselves and others it is important to pickup on more specific personality traits which comprehensively contribute to a personality type Clinicians including myself often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent which indicate a type of personality For example if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization needing to be on time planning and perfectionism these traits contribute to the type A personalitynbspspan stylelineheight 142857In addition to utilizing clinical judgment clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the DSM5 ICD10nbspspan

My boyfriend  and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better and that I cant be happy without him    How do I get away from this relationship, Im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse  One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinking  This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful nbspRegardless of how irrational wrong mean selfish intimidating thoughtless a partner is to the other the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions  Stick with what your own intuition tells you  There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on  Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree nbspPeople are in familiar patterns of daily behavior no one wants to suddenly be alone even if this only means showing up as a physical body not as a truly loving partner no one wants to start telling others about a breakup answer questions about it feel blamed worry what others think  These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart  Listen to yourself about leaving this guy Your inner self does not lie to you 
I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least    I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me, The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself  If it feels a little burdensome then look to balance what is too much with its opposite nbsp  Since youre giving a lot of empathy maybe youd like receiving a lot of empathy  In the situation you describe when you start empathizing with others real or cartoon ask yourself whether youve felt empathy coming in your direction lately  Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing  The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support say then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like  Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly nbspEmpathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it  Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world to know when you would like to receive their empathy  Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than youd like to handle without anyones kindness to support you  Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds  It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel  Sometimes the first step is the most difficult of accessing how you feel  Start with knowing the amount of empathy youd like from others and what stops you from asking  br  Also about your diagnosis and the lack of nbspstudies and lists and formulas nbspEach person is unique the instructions and guidelines dont necessarily mean very much nbspOften having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak stigmatized incompetentnbsp  Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better  The answers are inside you not inside a book or website 
After he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful  Now he is depressed and hopeless again, The fact that youre reaching out for help here is really helpful  The first thing I would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details how this is affecting you and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband  From the way that you describe this I wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital Perhaps you can have a conversation with your husband this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about his experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital and now things are not as good Perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him  I also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment  There may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again There are national crisis telephone numbers listed below as well

I start counselingtherapy in a few days Im freaking out but my main fear is that Ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about, People do cry in therapy sometimes but its not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful When you start counseling you dont yet know your counselor very well so its normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation Sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear If you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it Your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though its embarrassing finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it Its okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that youre kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person

Im depressed often and my mind goes a million miles a minute Every once in a while things are okay for a few days After a bit I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely After roughly a week the anxiety is back and still picking Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change, Hello and thank you for your question I am very sorry that you are struggling I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else br  Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens br  As you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back When they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication andor to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned br  Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so These are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression That is a very normal thing to do Nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them br  The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution In fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons br  Depression and anxiety cannbsp be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression Medication can be helpful but I still recommend counseling The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills br  Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC br

I was having a sexual relationship with a coworker He decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend Before I got paid I told him I would have 2500 which I thought I would But when I saw my paycheck I could not pay the 2500 He says I lied to him about it He wants me to reimburse him 2500 for the hotel room he decided to get He stayed at the hotel and I left I dont think its right that he want me to reimburse him 2500 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place He is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me I am a liar and that I should never said I was going to have 2500 when I knew I wasnt I told him I had to pay rent and my rent was late He texted me saying I need to get two or three jobs,Hello and thank you for your question It really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 2500 If you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him then pay when you can I am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over 2500 I know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts You may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner brbrBe wellbrbrRobin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCCbr br

My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while She goes out gets trashed and then expects everyone to take care of her The next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated She also thinks everyone hates her all the time If I dont seem anything other than happy she asks me Do you hate me You hate me Tell me you love me and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before, It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it only she can We cant change what other people say think or do We can only change our reactions It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy You can reassure her that you like her if thats true but you dont have to pity her 
My dad is always and I mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all He makes me feel stupid He also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me Is this abuse, Yes screaming and cussing at your child is considered abuse  Here are two points I suggest you consider for your situation  If your dad is ever calm when you and him are with one another nbspask for some time to talk about your relationship with him  Schedule it for sometime in the near future from your request nbsp This way he has time to consider his points of view on his relationship to you nbsp  Even if he does no thinking about your relationship at all he will not feel pressured by the surprise of suddenly being expected to talk about a topic he may prefer to prepare himself  br  My second point to you is to keep steady in your own views of who you are nbspWhen a parent demeans and mistreats a child the child is affected in a negative way nbspConcentrate on loving yourself and keeping people in your friendship circle who care about you 
I have been married for 11 years Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me I feel very alone and just uncared for  Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected, Im sorry for how youre feeling in your marriage lately nbsp  Are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings nbsp  The way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinks  Your current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing this  If your husband wants to start talking with you then there is a chance the two of you can reconnect nbspIf he doesnt want to participate in the relationship with you then start to think if its possible and for how long to get emotional support from friends and family who do care for you  Also a question for the future is to understand what the value of your marriage is to you besides having a connection to your husband

I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home My family and I really need this job    People keep telling me I have anxiety and Im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road This is all new to me What can I do, There are lots of things you can do but first Congratulations on your new job nbspCommuting long distances can be stressful but there are some things you can do  First make sure that your seating arrangement in your car is comfortable If you are driving long distances on a regular basis you want to make sure that your body is in a comfortable position Second select some music or podcasts that work for you rather than against you Soothing music is good as well as inspirational podcasts Alternatively listening to books can be a great way to spend the time improve your mood and find inspiration Third make sure that you have plenty of time for your commute If the drive normally takes you 30 minutes plan on 45 or if its 45 minutes plan on an hour This way you wont be rushed can take your time can focus on your driving and if traffic is a bit backed up youve got plenty of time to reach your destination  Finally if you do find yourself being anxious in a way that impedes your driving pull over to the side of the road take some deep breaths and sit with your feelings Take a deep drink of water Consider jotting your feelings down in a journal If its safe get out of the car and walk around a bit stretching you muscles and breathing in the air  But most of all be kind to yourself I wish you much success in your new job  br 
I have been married for 11 years Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me I feel very alone and just uncared for  Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected, Piggybacking on the other respondents suggestions I also agree that most couples could use more frequent and more bonding communication in their relationships and this is a GREAT place to get the ball rolling towards reconnecting  Surveying the demographical data on longterm relationships its pretty common for couples to start to struggle around the 710 year mark and in fact thats often when first time divorces happen And for lots of reasonsmost of them having something to do with beginning to take one another for granted and no longer doing the little things that nourish the relationship and light our partners up nbspSeems like youve encountered this in your own relationshipwhere he appears to be neglecting your need for emotional connection with him  Doesnt have to be this way though And from my own personal clinical experience I can tell you that when even ONE partner is willing to make some small but powerful changes they can often ripple outward to the other partner and bring about miraculous outcomesnbsp  So my encouragement to you is this  if youre still in love with himeven a little bitand youre down to try something new theres hope nbspAs hard as it may be I would ask you to try and focus on YOUR own side of the street when approaching him Use an open and curious approach with himnbsp  Ask him what he thinks he needs in a marriagenbsp ullispan stylefontstyle italicWhat is it about you he fell in love withnbspspanlilispan stylefontstyle italicWhat helps him feel more fulfilled as a man and as a husbandnbspspanlilispan stylefontstyle italicWhat little things that you have done over the years does he appreciatenbspspanliuldivLike Sherry said if you can get him talking therell be plenty to work with We only need a spark to kindle a fire If he can give you a list youll have a blueprint for getting him to reconnect with you and it opens the door for you to offer him little suggestions as welldivdivbrdivdivBy the time a couple reaches the point where youre at theres usually very little fun going on Weve stopped enjoying one anothers company Try and think creatively about some shared experiences he might be willing to do A picnic Happy hour Concerts museums cooking class new sexual behaviorsthe list is as infinite as you want it to benbspbrbrdivdivSome of my favorite suggestions for couples looking to understand how they got here and how to build their way out aredivullia hrefhttpsyoutube8kVg1aGzM targetblankThe Secret to Desire in a LongTerm Relationshipa Ted Talk by Esther Perellilia hrefhttpamznto2aSu68j targetblankGetting Together amp Staying Together Solving the Mystery of Marriagea by William amp Carleen Glasserlilia hrefhttpamznto2aPD0xJ targetblankDivorce Busting  A Step By Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Againa by Michelle WeinerDavislilia hrefhttpamznto2b1viUg targetblankThe Relationship Cure a 5 step Guide to Strengthening your Marriage Family and Friendshipsa by John Gottman amp Joan DeClaireliliTa hrefhttpamznto2aPDdAT targetblankhe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Worka by John Gottman amp Nan Silverlilia hrefhttpamznto2aSuK2z targetblankThe Five Love Languagesa by Gary ChapmanliuldivAnd of course Id be remiss if I didnt suggest that if youre open to the idea maybe some individual and or couples counseling could be helpful toodivdivbrdivdivMy very warmest regards to youdivdivTamara Powell LMHCdiv

Im a female in my mid 20s  Lately I tend to over drink and Ive become a very angry drunk     In the past I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol     But now even if I dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking I dont understand why Im feeling this way Does this mean I have a problem, Usually when someone asks if they have a problem they believe they do have a problem  The first step is to understand your own theory and definition as to what problem you feel you have nbsp  Some possibilities are feeling unhappy in the relationship to your boyfriend not having enough discussion between the two of you not feeling cared about by your boyfriend not liking your boyfriend  Did you grow up in a family in which the grownups drank to the point of excess at the times they felt stressed  Family modeling of how to handle problems may have left you no knowing how to handle stress except to drink to excess  Ask yourself what it is you feel guilty of doing  The guilt may point you in a good direction if it is your sense of selfesteem telling you to find better ways of managing your life  Do you drink alone or together with friends  Try defining your specific reasons for drinking because this is the first step to know how to handle the situation differently 
Ive been with my partner for 4 years Shes given me no reason not to trust her But lately Ive been overreacting a lot when shes just doing normal things I think its triggering my bad past relationships    How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her, Two paths are possible  Youre not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriend  You are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this person  The only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feel  This will allow new light to open an answer as to the truth  Once you know what truly is going on between the two of you your selftrust naturally will grow strongernbsp  Selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust 
My husband and I have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times Others have told me that most men would have left me by now Honestly I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing I want to be better connected with my husband, There are many different ways that can be approached in your situation  1 I would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex drive  2 Where is your husband in this situation Is he resentful accepting demanding or neutral  3 What is your past sexual history has this had an affect on your current issue  4Has there been problems in your past with abuse of any kind  5 Understand that intimacy is more than sex What other ways can you be close to your spouse  6 It sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of youCouples counseling would be a great place to startnbsp  All of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be established  You need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse 
I have been married for 11 years Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me I feel very alone and just uncared for  Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected, I can think of several things that may help you to reconnect I dont know how much time you actually spend together but one thing you could try is to spend 15 minutes a week together talking about common interests or other things that make you feel connected  Have you considered a date night or anything doesnt have to cost a lot of money but could make each of you feel special  Something else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right rather than just assuming so Communicating this way can feel awkward at times but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner Also you may discover that you are on two different pages about things on which you thought you understood what each other felt wanted or desired  Consider what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or special Can you name a few things and get them right according to your partner when you check in Can he do the same for you  You could also try doing two things every day that would be appreciated by your partner without either of you having to ask for it There is some more information here although what you do for one another does not necessarily need to be on this listnbspa hrefhttpwwwcouplesinstitutecomtrackingsuccessbydoingthedailydouble targetblankhttpwwwcouplesinstitutecomtrackingsuccessbydoingthedailydoublea  Reconnecting is a bit of a process Try to praise yourself and your partner for attempts that you make and recognize that youre not going to get it right 100 of the time You may also find this book to be helpful or there are other similar ones by the same authornbspa hrefhttpssmileamazoncomLoveLanguagesSecretthatLastsdp080241270Xrefsr11ieUTF8ampqid1471479801ampsr81ampkeywordsLovelanguageshttpssmileamazoncomLoveLanguagesSecretthatLastsdp080241270Xrefsr11ieUTF8ampqid1471479801ampsr81ampkeywordsLovelanguagesa  If this still seems difficult consider seeing a local mental health professional As one more thought recall that this relationship involves both of you If you are both committing to change your level of connection change will likely not be a steady uphill climb there could be plateaus or even some dips back in a negative direction and each of you may change at a different rate  Best wishes in your quest for connection 
I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least    I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me, It sounds like this would be difficult at times particularly if you feel misunderstood  You may or may not know that we all have chemicals in our brain We also have different sections of our brain that become active when different things happen There is a part of our brain where a lot of our emotions originate that is also designed to protect us when we are going through things that have been physically or emotionally painful in the past and when that part of the brain is sometimes overactive perceiving threat when there is no actual threat at the time sometimes anxiety can develop This doesnt necessarily mean that everyone has an anxiety disorder but often if we are afraid of something that is not actually a legitimate concern for example most insects are not going to hurt me but I still do not like them very much we have anxiety about it  The first thing I thought of when I read your question is that perhaps some part of your brain are overactive I did find an article that may be helpful to you but I just want to caution you Not everything listed here applies to you Also the article uses the term brain anomalies This does not mean that there is something majorly wrong with your brain While I cannot tell you exactly what is happening Im asking you not to panic over the term and to just consider that perhaps some of the chemical reactions in your brain may be a little overactive which may be able to be corrected with medication or something similar I cant tell for certain from what you posted whether or not this is what is happening but I would recommend that you either talk to your primary care physician or a therapist or psychiatrist  Here is the articlenbspa hrefhttpblogspsychcentralcomaddictionrecovery201209toomuchempathy targetblankhttpblogspsychcentralcomaddictionrecovery201209toomuchempathya  When you meet with your doctor or a therapist please try to convey how much this is affecting your life  Thank you so much for posting here and I wish you the best 
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything I was very embarrassed, Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we cant change We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and selfblame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes If you tune into your own thoughts or your internal dialogue youll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings So people who are holding onto embarrassment and selfblame often have thoughts like How could I do that I looked so stupid Now people saw things I did not want them to see If we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it These are selfsabotaging thoughts that lead to shame selfblame and embarrassment If you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as  We all make mistakes People can look all different ways at different time  this incident does not define me and If someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really OK People have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quicklybr 
Im a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings     My mood will be really high and Ill think of something that I want to do When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene Then if the thing I wanted to do doesnt work out I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out     Can you explain whats going on, Teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind  so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development You are not at all alone  Youve taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try  for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as I am responsible for my efforts and Blame is not helpful for anyone and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight When you practice thinking more rational healthy thoughts you are actually rewiring your brain so practice is key  br  br

I empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that I actually feel physical pain This has made life difficult to say the least    I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder But since its such a new disorder I cant find any information about it Could this be what is going on with me, Sometimes its helps to have a name for a problem  it can make you feel less alone as in oh theres a name for this and other people have this experience too On the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now I have a special problem that has a special name and thats an important part of who I ambrbrBottom line whether its a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings You might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy just like the volume dial or button on the tv that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel whats going on but its not so loud You can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far This is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability Just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted 
Ive been with my partner for 4 years Shes given me no reason not to trust her But lately Ive been overreacting a lot when shes just doing normal things I think its triggering my bad past relationships    How can I get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her, Whats most important is that you recognize that what youve been doing is off base  that what youve been feeling is overreacting that you have insecurities and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner Thats an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself its unlikely that you would changebrbrThat said you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth not because there is something wrong with you but because youre ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior Yes there are lots of selfhelp books and courses but we humans often make the most progress when we have support innbspspan stylelineheight 142857nbspspanspan stylelineheight 142857realtimespanspan stylelineheight 142857nbspfrom another human being who can sit with us point out our blind spots and teach us some skills that are hard to learn on our ownspan

I have a mother who is still running my life even though Im almost 30 years old I want to move out and live my own life but it feels like as long as I do what my mom wants our relationship is okay Its never okay if I dont do what she wants     I dont know how to start making my own decisions and not worry about  whether its right in her eyes  Would it help for me to talk to someone about this, If the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels okay is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life then this only seems ok  In fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done does not have their own ability to think for themselves  Separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters from your mothers point of view may be difficult  First realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourself  Youll need practice until you feel comfortable  Unless if youve been thinking through decisions youd like to make and the idea of your mothers anger is the only point which stopped you then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own life  Basically it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best nbspnbsp  Be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest 
On the first day of school I wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like I had bigger boobs  I did that the whole school year and my parents never found out But now I can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest     How do I fix this, Wear baggy clothes to disguise the problem and if you do this for a long enough time then your friends may forget what size boobs you have  Can you tell your parents what you wrote here nbsp  If yes then maybe they will be empathetic and this always helps  They may also agree to not make any comments about your boobs when you wear the bigger bra around your friends when they visit you at home  Also its possible your friends already have questioned why you wore a bigger bra than your boobs nbspMaybe they saw what was going on the whole time during the school year and felt too awkward to tell you 
I know Im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make  I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life but I just cant seem to even though I really want to Why cant I force myself to change, In general the reason people arent able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to change  What the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotions  If you havent got someone like this in your life which is common then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they are  Be patient with yourself too nbspChange sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change

I never feel like myself I cant even think straight anymore I start stuttering and I cant remember anything I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else I dont know why I feel this way but I hate it, Hello  I am wondering if you might be experiencing some form of dissociation nbspPeople who dissociate might feel like the world around them is unreal and unfamiliar or that they are not really in their bodies and that they are observing themselves from outside of their bodies nbspDissociation can also mean that there are parts of you that have split off and sometimes parts are can feel like they are at odds with each other or are locked in conflict nbspSometimes dissociation happens after someone experiences a trauma nbsp  Therapy can help you to understand what is going on and help you to integrate your experiences and ultimately heal  I am a therapist in Houston who specializes in dissociation nbspOn my website I have information a hrefhttpwwwsarahmcintyrelpccomcounselingfordissociationinhouston targetblankspecific to dissociationa that might be helpful to younbsp  span stylelineheight 142857Sarahspanbr 
I no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more I have fights with my fiance,Sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too nbspI would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger nbspI would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard nbspIts hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them

I dont feel like myself anymore For example I could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving I feel like Im watching my life be lived by someone else,You may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization nbspPeople with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror nbspDissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic nbspdivbrdivdivI would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own nbspOn my website I have some information specific to a hrefhttpwwwsarahmcintyrelpccomcounselingfordissociationinhouston targetblankdissociationa that you may find helpful nbspBest of luck to youdiv

I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuserape experiences Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner Im trying to learn to cope with them, Im glad youre willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered  One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people  Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are nbsp Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life is natural for anyone recovering from trauma  Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous nbsp Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized  Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation discussions and sex with your partner  Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process 
After he got home from the hospital he was angry then for a time wonderful  Now he is depressed and hopeless again, Since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel  Give yourself some time to concentrate on how youve been affected by your husbands suicide attempt nbsp Even if you decide against immediately telling him how youre feeling knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him  Is your husband talking easily with you  Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness  The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you  Depending on how far away you each are from such a position you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking ones own life 
I have three children The oldest is nine and not my biological child The middle child is three and the youngest is one I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times Is this normal, Congrats on being honest about the way you feel  Many people state having a favorite child so the reverse would also be possible of having a least favorite child  Try to understand your own reasons for not liking your youngest child as much as the others  One point to consider is whether it is the child personality or the way they interact with you which gives you the feeling of not liking this child as much as the others or does the reason have more to do with younger children requiring more care  Also do you generally prefer older kids to younger ones nbspnbsp  It is possible the problem will go away as your youngest grows older  Is there another parent in the household who can make up for what you feel unable to naturally give to your youngest  Is it possible you feel your own need to be involved with activities or to have time on your own nbsp Maybe you simply need a break from constant mothering  Continue to give as much as possible to your youngest child 
She refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past I dont know what to do My daughter blames me and swears she hates me    My parents say I should just let my daughter live with her dad but I dont see how I could fix things if I only see her every other weekend What should I do, Sorry to hear about your high degree of stress  How old is your daughter  Who abused yours daughter  The answers make a difference to your decision  Obviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with you  If someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one another  What does your daughter tell you she wants  Her wishes must be considered too  Relationships can be fixed nbsp Sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other 
Over a year ago I had a female friend She turned out to be kind of crazy so I decided to stop talking to her  When she would call me I wouldnt answer the phone This made my girlfriend really suspicious She would ask me why I wouldnt ever answer that phone number I told my girlfriend that I dont want to be friends with that other woman but I dont think she believes me How can I get my girlfriend to understand, Do you know why your girlfriend doesnt believe you  It is strange that your girlfriend prefers you to take the phone call of another woman  Have you blocked the unwelcome phone calls  Has your girlfriend said she doesnt believe you or is this your interpretation  Find out the answer and then ask your girlfriend to tell you her reasons behind her thoughts  It is much easier to help someone understand a situation if the person is engaged in a conversation  Whether or not she understands is up to her  All you can be responsible to do is to offer your explanation which sounds like youve already substantially offered  Keep or reintroduce the topic for the two of you to talk about again 
I have been married for 11 years Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me I feel very alone and just uncared for  Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected, Im sure youve tried to talk to your husband but if not could you Have a conversation with him about him and his life his work etc See if he relaxes and opens up to you even a little bit Dont try to have a heavy conversation or even unburden yourself to him during this first conversation  just try to be lighthearted and focus on hearing him Its the first step towards getting your needs met too and ending any emotional standoff that might have come about between you

I am a really shy person Im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident How can I get more confident, A good way to start is the language or self talk that is happening inside your mind nbspLooking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self nbspThe presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it nbsp What language can you change in your self talk nbspFor example are you saying I cant speak in front of an audience Ill fail nbspThat sounds a lot different than I studied my butt off and if I practice speaking out loud I can ace this presentation nbspAlthough this is a short answer I do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence nbspnbsp

I was raped a couple months ago Since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred I have been having trouble feeling emotions Its almost as if Im a sociopath lacking any feeling What can I do to change this, Terrible things do happen in life and I am sorry to hear about what happened to you Please rest assured that you are not a sociopath and that your reactions are normal responses to traumatic events Im guessing you are experiencing a sense of numbness which is a common response to trauma The best thing you can do is to get some trauma counseling with a professional counselor nbspAs you process your experience you will be able to feel emotions again However the first feelings to come back may be related to trauma such as fear panic and a sense of hyper vigilance A professional counselor will be able to help you tolerate these feelings manage them and heal from your trauma

Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together, Hello and thank you for your question First I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having This isnt always easy to do but it sure is important if you want to see improvement br  It does sound cliche but communication really is the bedrock of relationships And not just intimate partner relationships but really any relationship that is significant to us It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful I want to tell you that you are not alone Good communication skills are not really something you are born with we actually have to learn them The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that br  Ultimately some people must seek professional help through couples counseling in order to get help with this process This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries creating a plan learning new skills and staying on track If that is not something you can afford or can do right now here are a few suggestions that may help br  Personally I am big fan of Dr John Gottman He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great easytoread book called span stylefontstyle italicThe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work spanDr Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have which can be helpful and worth trying You can buy Dr Gottmans book on Amazon for under 9 Its a good deal br  There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication Here is one that I found that has a few good tips br  httpwwwhelpguideorgarticlesrelationshipseffectivecommunicationhtm   You can try them and see if they are helpful br  It is important to remember that like all new skills communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it If you were ever a pitcher in baseball then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently Allow yourself to make mistakes own them and start again br  I hope these suggestions help and good luck  Robin Landwehr DBH LPCC br 
Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together, Thanks for your question Becoming a good listener is an essential piece in being a better communicator Being an effective communicator will almost always improve the quality of your relationshipsnbsp  What stands in your way of listening to her Do you find yourself becoming defensive when she brings up issues Do you often find yourself thinking of what you want to say next Do you take her words personally preventing you from having the ability to problem solve  Here are some tips that may help you with being a better listener  1 Concentrate on what you are hearing not on what you will say next  2 Ask questions if you need clarification or dont understand  3 Summarize what youre hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that youre not missing anything  4 Ask your partner what she needs from you Is she expecting advice or does she simply need to vent  5 Keep eye contact and avoid using nonverbal cues that demonstrate defensiveness or irritation such as eye rolling or crossing your arms  6 Remember that its okay to disagree and if this is the case then decide as a team how you want to move forward  I hope this helps Good luck to you

Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together, The first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that so you are already on the right track  As far as learning how to listen try some of these steps ulliAsk whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationliliIf she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience These questions usually begin with words like who what where when Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicateliliThen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience You could also start by talking about something that is important to youliliRemember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesnt mean that you agreeliliAlso try sticking to one subject at a time Its difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twoliliTry to use the word want or wish instead of need Saying that you need something or if your girlfriend would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changeliul Something else to try would be using some sort of timeout Consider this ulliDiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five 10 15 minutes or maybe even an hour When there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceivingliliWhen using timeout say to your girlfriend or she can say to you I need an hour before we can go back to this Then actually come back to the discussionliliSome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way This is why the agreement is important before you need itliul While it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice  Try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of your partner  As one final idea consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problemsolving about anything just connecting with one another  I encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you  Best wishes 
Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together, The best tool for becoming a better listener that I know of is called Imago Dialogue It consists of 3 steps  1 Mirroring what she says without judging commenting refuting defending arguing or scoffingjust listening no matter the content and repeating it back wordforword Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt  2 Validating You tell her you you understanding why she feels this way If you dont understand then find a way You can also say That makes sense or I hear you or I get that  3 Empathizing Tell her how you think she must feel about what shes telling you Your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her  This is a very different way of communicating than were used to My guess is that the arguments discussions and debates youve had with her have been counterproductive because youre both trying to win With Imago Dialogue you both win She gets to be heard and you get to hear for a change  At the end of the exercise switch roles For more infonbsphttpimagorelationshipsorgpubaboutimagotherapyimagodialogue101 
I am a really shy person Im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident How can I get more confident, Have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class nbspnbspbr  The more confident you feel in a safe space the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger group  Giving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication nbsp It has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearly  Practice practice and practice until you see yourself improve in how you present  Also keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxious  Anxiety heightens fear so whatever concerns you have check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivity  Good luck 
I was raped a couple months ago Since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred I have been having trouble feeling emotions Its almost as if Im a sociopath lacking any feeling What can I do to change this, Sociopaths dont know they are sociopaths  Clearly you realize you have pretty deep emotions and have lived through several severely distressing situations  Your sense of self may be protecting for a while until you recover the practical aspects of daily life and feel some sense of predictability and stability in your life  Knowing and feeling disturbing emotions which rupture basic trust that other people are safe is itself a raw process  Yes it is possible to become numb emotionally nbsp The good purpose is to protect you from additional hurt  When your inner world feels itself ready more of your emotions from the recent distressing events will be accessible  If many months pass and you see no progress then definitely consider a few sessions with a therapist who would be able to guide you to become more open to your feelings 
My boyfriend shows affection but I just push him away  Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me I almost always push him away Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive      I love him so much  Why do I do this, Are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex drive  My guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changing  Birth control pills control ovulation nbsp They dont directly prevent people from all desire to express affection  Allow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your BF nbsp It is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward him  And maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship 
I just feel sad all the time and I dont like anyone in my family I feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow, Hello  While one can be sad from time to time feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression If you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life However feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family Is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved Is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process You do not have to deal with it alone Dr Virginia Chow Montreal Psychologist For more information about depression please consult my website at a hrefwwwPsychologyResourceca targetblankwwwPsychologyResourcecaa

My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that Im doing things she finds disrespectful even when I dont mean it like that For example she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart  I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  She doesnt and never will say she was wrong How do I get her to understand,Hello That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concernsnbspdivbrdivdivOne is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me In other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needsnbspdivdivbrdivdivThe second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said nbspIf she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsdivdivbrdivdivThe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of Im sorry However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientatingnbspdivdivbrdivdivFor more information about these services you are welcome to read my materials on my website at wwwPsychologyResourceca or to contact me at 514

My boyfriend shows affection but I just push him away  Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me I almost always push him away Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive      I love him so much  Why do I do this, There could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away It could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him awaynbsp  What is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect So what if you arent a hugger a kisser or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship There are many ways to show affection that arent physical words of affirmation giving of time andor gifts etc If your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching 
My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that Im doing things she finds disrespectful even when I dont mean it like that For example she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart  I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  She doesnt and never will say she was wrong How do I get her to understand, Here is the truth You will never get her to understand because that would mean changing her and we cant change other people we can only change ourselves I would recommend to take the time to self reflect on what exactly it is that you are doing that is contributing to the mixup You both have very valid feelings and those wont magically go away until you address the root problem which could be many factorsnbsp  I am curious to know more about past relationships the both of you have had and how that plays a role in your current relationship Many times we dont realize how past relationships truly impact our current behaviorsnbsp 
My husband and I have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times Others have told me that most men would have left me by now Honestly I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing I want to be better connected with my husband, I work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges The one aspect I tell many folks that I work with is this Every person and relationship is different There really isnt a normal amount of sex a person should have or want to have If having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband there is nothing wrong with it If you or your husband would like to have sex more often I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied br  The aspect of connectedness is an important one While sex can be very connecting for many couples it isnt the only way to connect I find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex checking in to see how you and your husband feel as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this needbr 
My husband and I had our first threesome recently Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me     He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now Im craving more of it But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling Why am I feeling this way, Hello and thank you for your question Nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common Indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new br  Many people who engage in open polyamorous andor othertype relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes This doesnt prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one And many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work Of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception br  There could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do One reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are Some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this Another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages They are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc Just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesnt mean that you havent been influenced by them We all have br  Another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening Perhaps there are a lot of What ifs going on in your mind When you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling br  One thing that I do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband It may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will It is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it br  If you continue to struggle I suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexualitynbsp I wish you well  br  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC br

We werent long distance until he joined the military  I love him and I know he loves me but its complicated He said hes not going to find someone else but Im afraid How do I keep our relationship going, Hello You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship Although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connectionnbsp  Without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him nbspOr is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future The more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecurenbsp  However if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship To help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust Is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment For many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and Skype Its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life Other times it is Making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence Regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance onesnbsp  Dr Virginia Chow  wwwPsychologyResourceca 
We werent long distance until he joined the military  I love him and I know he loves me but its complicated He said hes not going to find someone else but Im afraid How do I keep our relationship going, Youre right that longdistance relationships can be complicated If he loves you and you love him thats a great start I wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved valued special and appreciated  When having important discussions consider the following ulliMake sure it is a good time to have a discussion and if youre doing it in writing because of the distance you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesnt have 10 minutes or something like thatliliTry to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other Asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversationsliliWhen having discussions facetoface I often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them As for how that translates to distance maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the Internet or if possible use some kind of timeframeliul Consider what questions you would like answers to For example are you wondering ulliWhat should I do if I miss you or want to talk to you more I dont want to make you feel guilty but I also dont want to hide my feelings Can I share them with youliliIf you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly can I keep sending you messages or is that overwhelmingliliHow will you ask for support from meliliSome couples really want to protect each other In doing so instead of hiding our emotions can we share them and work through them togetherliliWhatever else comes to mindliul Gary Chapman is famous for his books about the 5 Love Languages He has one specifically for military familiesnbspThe 5 Love Languages Military Edition The Secret to Love That Lasts  Heres a list of books related to loving from a distancenbsphttpwwwlongdistancerelationshipsnetbookstorhtm  I have not read these books myself but I have read other works by a lot of the authors  One final tip Consider making a list of times when you work together and both feeling calm safe and comfortable These memories could be helpful to you during difficult moments  Best wishes to you Remember that you could each see therapists in your respective locations if that would be helpful to you 
I want to live with my mom My dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault I still talk to my mom although My dad tells me that Im no allowed to Im scared I will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me     How do I tell him that I want to live with my mom, There is a lot of information that needs to be filled in firstnbsp  So what the custody arrangement Does your dad have full custody Is the custody sharednbsp  What does your mom think about the situation Is she willing to go to bat for you  What is your age Usually you have the right to choose based on age requirements set by the state  Legally you cant be kept away from your mom unless there is some legal complications that prevent it  Is your father abusive and should you seek protection  Many details need to be filled in  You can seek counseling without your parents approving or knowing depending on your age  Find counseling through school or local agencies  You have rights and one of those is the right to choose 
I feel so alone I have so many people around me but it seems as they just listen and dont understand  They say it will all be okay or they dont listen to me st all  Everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are Why do I feel so alone, You ask a very deep and sensitive question which reflects good selfawareness  It is possible you are a more sensitive and aware person than the people whom you describe as listening and not really hearing you  Not everyone has the same capacity or willingness to pay careful attention to what is going on in life  Maybe for right now until you are able to find in person friends whom youre able to feel hear you the way youd like to be heard find online forums and groups of likeminded people  If you google a topic which you wish your friends would be better at understanding there will be scores of groups including google groups which come up  Youre not alone in the sense that there are definitely people on this earth who are sensitive caring and willing to talk and understand others 
Weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker I dont know how to approach this situation How do I ask him about it, If youd like to ask a question then go ahead and ask  Boyfriendgirlfriend is a close relationship and it is usually understood as an exclusive relationship nbspYoure definitely entitled to know if your wishes to not have him texting another woman are being respected  Often people are afraid to ask because they fear the truth will hurt them  In the short term this is definitely true  In the long term knowing you are getting what you want and at the very least stating your expectations to your boyfriend will clarify for him what is meaningful in your relationship 
We werent long distance until he joined the military  I love him and I know he loves me but its complicated He said hes not going to find someone else but Im afraid How do I keep our relationship going, Youre wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods  All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes keep in contact as much as possible and wait to see how your relationship unfolds  To a large degree each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while then it will nbsp The military may add stress  This doesnt necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship  Sometimes all anyone is able to do is try 
Weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker I dont know how to approach this situation How do I ask him about it, I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others These questions help couples to build connection and trust Its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance If he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide Either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that If he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions  br  Dr Virginia Chow  wwwPsychologyResourceca 
I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes How can I start accepting myself and be more confident, This happens slowly and can be done  You already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of selfloathing are the best of what youre able to expect from life  A way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisions  If you start to notice what youd like from an interaction and afterwards reflect on how well you handled yourself especially with any unexpected circumstances youll build confidence in your ability to be good at something  Do you know why you hate yourself  This answer may help you address within yourself  a new type self talk which has more positives in it than what youve been accustomed to telling yourself 
Im obsessing about a terrible breakup Everything is a constant reminder  How do I move on, Let yourself know what you feel nbspnbsp  There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them  Probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders the sooner you will feel fresh and new again 
My wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that Im doing things she finds disrespectful even when I dont mean it like that For example she gets offended when I call someone at work sweetheart  I wish I had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  She doesnt and never will say she was wrong How do I get her to understand, You may not get her to understand your point of view with any more success than your wife is having with you to do the same  It is possible you are a balanced couple in the sense of neither one of you understanding the other  The deeper question to ponder is whether each of you can accept the other person even though you each have very different terms for defining cheating  You will find either there are enough strong similarities to keep the two of you happy as a couple or there arent these similarities  Then the new question would be whether either of you want to address your findings or not 
I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it but I dont know how What can I do, Hello and thank you for your question Overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another Sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them There are some options  1 You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing For example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage itnbsp br  br  2 There are different websites and even some selfhelp books that you can use to try to overcome your fears When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy wellstudied and proven to work A therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself I am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools httppsychologytoolsanxietyhtml  br  Some colleagues may offer you some other types of advice Be well  Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCCbr  br 
I feel so alone I have so many people around me but it seems as they just listen and dont understand  They say it will all be okay or they dont listen to me st all  Everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are Why do I feel so alone, Although we can have moments when we feel alone even with the presence of family and friends feeling alone most of the time could be a sign that there is a lack of connection between you and your loved ones Generally the lack of connection can occur when you dont feel heard understood or valued These are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of lonelinessnbsp  You mentioned that they listen but dont understand Do you communication clearly about what you need emotionally understood accepted valued heard empathized To help you ask for the right type of support you can ask yourself what it is about the situation that is bothering you and how you would wish for your friends and family to respond to you The result may be an answer that is more informative to your loved ones For example you might say Thank you for listening to me When I feel alone I feel like nobody cares about me because everybody seems busy with their lives I just wanted to hear and feel that Im valued by receiving caring messages and phone callsnbsp  br  Dr Virginia Chow  wwwpsychologyresourceca 
I know Im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make  I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life but I just cant seem to even though I really want to Why cant I force myself to change,Hello and thank you for your question Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important Here are a few things I would suggestbrbr1 Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed Sometimes we will set a goal like I want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence Whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change brbr2 If you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it So if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual brbr3 If you are going to make changes really nail down WHY you want to make them What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person For example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there brbr4 Once you know WHY you want to make these changes I strongly suggest setting small goals If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse So make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person brbr5 As Sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck Any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help br br  Be well  Robin Landwehr DBH LPCCbr

Sometimes Im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth Ive always thought it was normal and I was just nervous but the other day it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself, Feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes were not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety i e heart racing sweaty palms sweating shortness of breath Its important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body amp mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals like adrenaline or cortisol nbspSo one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety such as fear stress negative thought patterns not enough food or sleep Keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills amp techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep One quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes sometimes this is called belly breathing When you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates Many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress amp anxiety nbsp

My husband and I had our first threesome recently Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me     He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now Im craving more of it But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling Why am I feeling this way, You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other Are you having issues Fighting Not feeling satisfied with each other How has your sex life been with each other nbspIf there are any problems insecurities issues introducing something like this may only make your relationship worsenbsp  Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well Sure there are some who successfully live this lifestyle but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other harbor no jealousies or insecurities and arent looking to someone else to satisfy needs that arent getting met by their spousenbsp  Let me say that again This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure jealous or looking to have needs met by this other person that you arent getting from your spousenbsp  That empty feeling youre having  listen to it Dig deep to find out where it is coming from What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way Youll get the answer  The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other If you dont like it that he paid more attention to the other girl he needs to know that and he needs to respect that nbspIf youre going to do it again he needs to know what youre comfortable with and what you want Set the limits before youre in the moment before its too late to take an action back Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman  It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship People who marry young andor inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them but dont want to hurt their spouse The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot If there are problems in your relationship this is likely to only make things worse 
I am a heterosexual male in my late 20s I find myself wearing pantyhose heels skirts and other womens clothing in private I am torn on how to feel about it I enjoy it very much I have had a pantyhosestocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since I was young I have no history of sexual abuse growing up I am currently single,p classMsoNormalHi there It sounds like you have already started to answer  your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and I am  glad you enjoy it Cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is  no harm in it whatsoevernbsp p classMsoNormalMy question to you would be What is making you feel torn  about it There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with  people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the  majority And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or  even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when  it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone p classMsoNormalBeing a sexual or gender minority or someone who  participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a  unique and personal way often means suffering from something called  internalized oppression We grow up being exposed to certain  assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even  face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell  us to Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize  them and feel guilty about who we are There is nothing wrong with us but  feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment  or like something is wrong with us p classMsoNormalBut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud  of who you are and what you enjoy You can continue to simply enjoy it  privately or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe  even join a community with similar interests Ill leave you with a quote from  comedian Eddie Izzard who identifies as in his own words a straight  transvestite Theyre not womens clothes Theyre my clothes I  bought them Take care and thanks for your question p classMsoNormalopop

Weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years I recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker I dont know how to approach this situation How do I ask him about it, Just ask him  Im not sure how you saw his phone if youre in a long distance relationship because long distance means you live far apart from each other and dont get to see each other in person Therefore I think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you  I dont know how old you are but if youre an adult after two and a half years I dont think its unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect Long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you dont ever see each other in person Talking texting and video chatting isnt enough and the longer the physical distance remains the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness It may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when if ever the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that long Do you both want the same things out of life If one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesnt then it doesnt matter if its long distance or not  if you arent on the same page with the relationship it is going to be difficult to make it work  Trust is important Issues with trust insecurity jealousy lying andor hiding things from each other being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation  these things can ruin relationships if not addressed I know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people but it is necessary at times Evaluate your true feelings for him Are you with him for reasons other than love such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldnt be able to find someone else Has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before Some people unfortunately develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them However if this is not the case you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecuritiesnbsp  It may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship figure out what you want and make a decision This may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level Or it could lead to a decision to end things I know that can be difficult but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness 
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed She told me that she wants to move What can I do to help her  I want her to stay, Youre probably not going to like my answer  Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her Sometimes whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what YOU want  Addictions dont happen in a vacuum If youve had any experience with addicts at all then Im sure youve heard the term enabler A lot of the times when people think theyre helping theyre actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink continuing to do so or relapsing back into it  You said she recently quit You said she is depressed She wants to move When a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this They need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times It means moving to new locations Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed Not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they usedrink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy  Dont pressure her to stay Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do If she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone It doesnt need to be made under pressure That will only lead to resentment Support her but dont try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons Let her go It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now It wouldnt be a bad idea for you to do the same 
I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it but I dont know how What can I do, Biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm Fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situationnbsp  A phobia however is different You used the term fear rather than phobia A phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing If your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome it  Everyone has fears or things that make them nervous Public speaking asking a person out fear of failure Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear When you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue A lot of times it is a selfesteem issue You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issuenbsp  Some fears are caused by trauma Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to In cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear I strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims 
I feel like I hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes How can I start accepting myself and be more confident, The answer would require a more indepth knowledge of you and your situationnbsp  A lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way You internalize it and accept it as your realitynbsp  The first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents Even if you are an adult think back to your childhood Children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems The obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person  You may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally Were you yelled at berated put down Were you told youd never amount to anything Were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations When you hear something over and over again you start to believe it  Maybe you werent yelled at Maybe it was the opposite Studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect A chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless She may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performancesnbsp  If one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being met  Any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they dont matter  Maybe nothing Ive described here fits your situation If you cant pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can help  I am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it Quite the opposite Understanding WHY you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition  figure out the WHY Then behavior  the HOWnbsp 
My dad makes me feel like shit and like Im worthless  He calls me names and makes me feel depressed  I want to move out because I swear if I stay here Im going to lose it What can I do, Are you old enough to move out Then by all means whats stopping you  If not is it possible for you to move in with another family member  If youre a minor CPS may need to step in They often do in cases of abuse Your safety is the number one priority  Its difficult to offer advice without knowing more about your situation But I can say this Dont let other people define your self worth You can choose NOT to allow him to make you feel anything It really is that simple By looking at it as a choice you make you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your selfworth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat you  Let me say that again in a different way Your selfworth is NOT defined by someone else The way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person  not you Dont take ownership of thatnbsp  I understand that if you are a minor setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult Reach out to others for help But if you are 18 and over there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment Put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally You owe it to yourself and deserve to live a healthy happy life Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong 
My boyfriend shows affection but I just push him away  Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me I almost always push him away Im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive      I love him so much  Why do I do this, I sympathize with you It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other and can lead to discord in the relationship The good news is there are ways to deal with this  You may have already answered your question There are many medications that can alter ones sex drive If your birth control pills are the cause of this talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand You may even consider alternate methods for birth control such as condoms  However there are some other things to ask yourself First you used the term affection but then talked about sex Theyre not the same thing There are different kinds of intimacy and many different ways to show love for someone A book you might find useful is The Five Love Languages  Defining what affection means to you and to him and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other may help lessen some of your anxiety over this  Humans are hardwired to need appropriate physical touch In fact studies have shown that newbornspremies who can receive skinonskin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who dont receive this touch Its called Kangaroo Carenbsp  Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where theyre not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when theyre adults One question to ask yourself is were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication If so there may be other deeper issues at play here  For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexualphysical touch sexual abuse physical beatings it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you A therapist could help you work through this  Sometimes a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship Once those issues are resolved the sex drive comes back Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy if youve been arguing a lot or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed  Finally look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a nonsexual way You may be doing things for each other that you dont even realize and noticing these will help you appreciate it more Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways Some people like to give gifts do the other persons chores or do other things they think the person will appreciate  If after all of this you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful It is a very common issue for a lot of couples 
I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it but I dont know how What can I do, Fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance Ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge We would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie Batman Begins Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them Secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said Im scared of snakes I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in Manhattan  Hope that helps br  Cbr

My fianc and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me     I recently found out he cheated on me with another women  He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do  Is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on, I think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question nbspI think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again nbspOnce you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions nbsp  First if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work nbspBut theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed nbspYou say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core nbspWould you agree with that or what are your thoughts nbspWere you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives nbspIf you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs nbspFor instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested nbspThis is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations nbspIn essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL nbspUntil he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually nbspThis leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling nbspYou need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called The Five Love Languages nbspIts not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening really  This is a long post Im sorry nbspBut this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it nbspSo back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this nbspFor instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again nbspOf course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt nbspYou need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back nbspYou cant just tell him vaguely I need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it nbspBut be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him nbspGet that book  In conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache nbspThere is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place nbspRebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past nbspI truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there nbspIf you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again

Im 17 and Im sick and tired of going back and forth Id like to stay at my mothers house This problem has really affected me Ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and selfharm in the past     Currently Im going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available How do I handle this, Have you told either of your parents that the current house rotation of where you stay bothers you  Since each parent has an interest to be together with you I imagine that to some degree each cares how you feel  If these conversations are not getting your problem solved then maybe your therapist can have a family session with your parents together and depending on the outcome with you and each parent

My fianc and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me     I recently found out he cheated on me with another women  He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do  Is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on, Its possible but challenging Both partners need to be feel motivated enough to repair the relationship and dedicated to the work needed to address whatever underlying issues led to the serious breach of trust For some people cheating is an absolute deal breakerfor others the context of the cheating allows them to see it as a mistake that they can forgive their partner for So it depends on how you feel about the relationship and whether you want to put in the work to repair it  If youre not sure how you feel counseling can help you resolve the ambiguity either individually or with your partner Then depending on what you decide a counselor can help you either repair the relationship or decouple from your former partnerbr 
I just dont know what I want in life anymore Im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused I cant put things into perspective at all Im just stuck and Im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments, If you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself nbspIf this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot nbspMaybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothlynbsp  Over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own nbspYou might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you nbspIf you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family its easy to recreate this in adult relationships  In both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self nbspBasically you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment nbspBefore you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are nbspSupporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them nbsp  In conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life nbspIt sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now nbspTake one small step at at a time nbspIdentify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching nbspMeanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing foodbr 
My exwife married and used me to have a child She now uses that child as a pawn I know my child misses me but I need to move on and not live in the past How do I do this Do I see my child as much as possible or very little Is it more confusing for the child, You can move on and not live in the past in the context of your exrelationship but that does not mean moving on from your child Moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs development  Generally its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress That requires the two adults to span stylefontstyle italicactspan like adults with each other for the sake of their child  Whats confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or worse not following through on commitments  But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their expartner then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to himher depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn When dealing with a hostile expartner your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your expartner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child If you cannot come to an agreement a counselor can help mediate a conversation If thats not an option then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which youd have to consult with an attorneybr

My depression has been reoccurring for a long time It all started when I was being bullied in high school In ninth grade my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates After that I was fine for a couple of years I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work I believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her Obviously that wasnt the right choice I regret ever doing that seeing as even though Im not selfharming anymore I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed I have a big problem with handling problems in life Whenever a problem arises I get stressed and I feel hopeless as if its not going to get better I get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldnt be sad all the time and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones, I couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own nbspUnfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harmnbsp  From what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage nbspOften when I am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress nbspWhen we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelmingnbsp  Stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly For example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties Try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own timenbspbr  Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress For example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity nbspIs that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements  Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you

Does counseling really do anything that can help people, Counseling allows us to have a sacred space a space that is set apart from the outside world it is a space of nonjudgement and exploration Being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves It allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes our behaviors and our feelings Imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank although I dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks I would imagine he does not see the world outside of him he only sees the small fishbowl oblivious to the outside world when one comes into the counseling room one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there Remember the observer affect one cannot truly act objectively with the world we are in a dynamic relationship with life it reacts to us and we to it the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits allowing us to see what was before hidden often times in plain sightbr

My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned She calls me every day complaining but I dont want to hear it anymore, It is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece You cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandonednbsp  Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation Nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourselfnbsp  It is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support In this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday Its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance When empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help  After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite You could then say to her if she complains again I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is explain what you could do to help  br  wwwPsychologyResourceca

My brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication Hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in 12 degree weather    I was adopted in by his dad who just passed and his mother will not Get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility     Do I have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility, Family members sometimes get Power of Attorney over vulnerable adults If you had this you could do something like that Im assuming that you dont though There are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed but it is a long processnbsp  I deal with situations like this everyday on the job The only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor such as at an emergency room to be a threat to self or others For instance if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out he could be placed on a short hold but these holds only last for a few days This still isnt a longterm solutionnbsp  An adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices no matter how bad those choices are If you have a way to get him to an ER whenever things like that happen such as being found sleeping outside in 12 degree weather it will help a lot They may or may not do a short term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the ER but its a start They can help set him up with appointments for psych and he can get on medications You can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled However you cant force him to take the meds so this may be something that happens a lot With enough of a paper trail of many ER visits and that sort of thing youll stand a better chance of getting a court appointed psych ward staynbsp  Some tips about ER visits Dont send him alone Always go with him or have someone go with him because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into whats going on than he will He may say everythings fine and he wants to leave so they wont have any reason to keep him if that is the case Go with himnbsp  If you do get Power of Attorney take the paperwork with you when you go to the ER and to doctors appointments because they arent just going to take your word They need to see the actual paperwork Having it on file in their system isnt good enough because paperwork expires etc Take it with you at all times You can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of whats going on  Keep in mind that if you do get Power of Attorney this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him Otherwise you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect In fact your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help She wont be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills but should be held responsible for his safety Someone should There are group homes for people with schizophrenia  Being responsible for someone doesnt mean you have to pay their bills it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need That care may be placement in a longterm care facility like a group home or a nursing home Psych inpatient hospitals arent longterm so you do need to look into other longterm options Psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him theyre not where someone stays forever  Good luck and keep up the good attitude Work with his treatment team Ask for a social worker If they see family that is wanting to do the right thing and wanting to help theyll help you even if it does take a while to get things sorted out The worst thing any of you can do is NOT go to appointments and that sort of thingnbsp

Cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters I decided not to break up the family However now I am struggling to forget and forgive what happened I feel like I cannot trust him Without trust I cannot stay in this relationship On the other hand I do not want my children to get hurt Im not sure how to move forward, To begin Im sorry to hear about your situation Like many of the professionals have stated infidelity is a very difficult obstacle to move forward from Its not impossible While forgetting is probably the hardest part forgiveness is something that can and will happen There are things you can do to help yourselfnbsp  The first this is identifying what you feel is best for yourself and your children That means being honest with how you feel being in this relationship on a daily basis and understanding how its affecting younbsp  Second how is your relationship affecting the children Do you feel that by staying in the relationshipnbspthat its affecting your daily interaction with them If so that something to keep in mindnbsp  Next Really looking at the pros and cons of staying in the relationship A specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications Viceversa for leaving Include your partner I think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking is could be a great option At least you arent keeping something inside yourself to manage Rather you are being transparent to them Sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan to how to move forward Regardless if you cant trust him and that feeling will never go away its time to address it Couple therapy can be beneficial as well as a therapist can provide professional counseling to younbsp  Earl Lewis  wwwRelationshipsGoneRightcom

My mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned She calls me every day complaining but I dont want to hear it anymore, This sounds like a possible boundary issue Boundaries are important in relationships They are invisible lines that we will or will not cross It is up to us to create and hold them We have the ability to rethink them and change them as needed It sounds like you have thought it through and would like to makes changes in the relationship between your mother and you In the main question you want to avoid the family member however in the following comment it sounds like you may just want the avoid that conversation not so much your mothernbsp  Once we review the issue and decide what we need create the boundary I suggest opening talking with the person when everyone is calm not in the middle of a stressful moment when we often are unable to focus and hear the other person Always understanding that we had time to think about this issue and the other person has not catching them off guard State clearly your need Such as I am not comfortable with hearing about my sister It stresses me out I would appreciate it if you would not bring it up anymore If you do I will not respond and I will change the subject  It is important to use I statements I feel this way I will do this We only have power over our actions Also when we use you  comments the other person can become defensive and unable to hear what we are sayingnbsp  Once we let ourselves know what we need then let the other people know our new boundary then it is up to us to follow through We will make mistakes Not follow through every time with our boundary That is okay Start again It gets easier with practice It is also appropriate to reconsider and change your boundary as needed Just let the others know when you need to change it Remember they can not read our mindsnbsp  I wish you much strength and hope the best for you and your family  wwwparishhealthandwellnesscom

Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Everyone has different experiences going to therapy Being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel Emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves I would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this That way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor There are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions Your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety In individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors As you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationshipnbsp 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Hi therenbsp  Thank you for your question Its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist There can be a few reasons why you might feel this waynbsp  First it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himhernbsp  Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things As children we might have bad experiences opening up to others Someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others If this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to sharenbsp  And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficultnbsp  Regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapistnbsp

Ive been suppressing it for quite some time but there are days when I cant make eye contact with her I think she knows and we both admitted there was some type of vibe but the overall discussion was vague I think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us Its driving me crazy As an act of expression I have purchased a gift for her thats personalized I havent given it to her yet, There are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace nbsp  Sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace nbsp

My fianc and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before He is having a hard time accepting my past especially  that Im not a virgin He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others     His insecurities are hurting our relationship How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present, One of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself but you cant make goals for your partner If your fianc wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cant independently make it happen  I wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative reporter so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc At that point maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as well  Also if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples Sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached so it is often helpful to have someone there to assist  It may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued appreciated special or loved and also consider what makes your fianc feel that way 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Well its generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through much less to someone who you dont know well can be anxietyproducing Its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for you  The most important thing I can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so its a good thing to discuss Personally I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100 of the time That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences andor whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety  Thanks for writing here If it caused anxiety for you to do so I hope that feeling is diminishing for you at least related to writing here

I just dont know what I want in life anymore Im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused I cant put things into perspective at all Im just stuck and Im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments, Thank you for sharing It can be very disorienting not to know what you want and where you are headed Sometimes we are so focused on something we havent achieved yet or on comparing ourselves to others that we lose touch with what we actually want and need At times like this its important to go back to basicsnbsp  Try out this simple exercisenbsptake a few minutes to write down all your present responsibilities For example make meals complete homeworketc nbspThen in the column next to it write down the things that you do for yourself to recharge yourself and to enjoy your timenbsp  Is your list of responsibilities way longer than your list of stuff you do for yourself It is easy to get lost in the sea of responsibilities and disconnect from what you want and need To fix that write another list of things that you enjoyed doing in the past for yourself and start incorporating them into your schedule on a regular basis This will help you reconnect with yourself and bring focus and clarity to your life 
Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me     How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time, Unfortunately you cant directly change another persons behavior However you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you The best way to provide feedback is in 3 parts The first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he doesnt listen such as hurt sad and unloved I would stay away from feelings such as frustrated angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion The second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific Example when I get home and tell you about my day and you dont look away from the tv Be objective as possible when you describe his behavior And the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific Example I would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day Here is an example with all 3 parts together I feel hurt when you dont say anything to me when I tell you about my fight with my friend I want you to hug me and tell me you understand how I feel Hope that helps

Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, If you have only been to a couple of sessions it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first Therapy is hard work You may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before Opening up to stranger can be scary After you feel comfortable with your counselor and trust has built up and you feel understood in session you should feel more relaxed I would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky Sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work If you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from For example are you and the therapist not a good fit But again if you are just starting out in working together feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense and I encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling 
Im in my mid 20s with a husband and children I love my family but I feel like Ive lost my identity and I dont know who I am other than a mom and wife At times all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped but I know Id feel like worse without them I loathe myself at times I have an amazing life so why cant I just enjoy it, It is not easy being a wife and mother You have shifted roles in your life You went from having a career to focusing on your family Transitioning can be hard especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can I think it is great that you are selfaware and want to work on this  Feeling unhappy and trapped may also mean that you are nbspbelieving these negative thoughts are absolutely true We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true nbspIs it really true that you trapped You also said that you have an amazing life It doesnt sound like you are only having negative thoughts You have some positive ones too However you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts more weight than the positive ones  I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought that it is a negative thought that thinking it does not make it true and to let it go This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions  Best of luck to you

Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Yes it is completely normal to feel anxious about therapy Therapy often explores topics and feelings that are uncomfortable The ultimate goal of therapy is to feel better but the process itself can be uncomfortable

My fianc and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me     I recently found out he cheated on me with another women  He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do  Is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on, Betrayal in a relationship can be one of the most difficult things a relationship can sustain Sometimes feelings about the betrayal may also trigger past wounds The fact that it only happened once may not make it any easier to move forward I highly recommend working with a mental health professional who has experience working around the issue of infidelity Together you can work on healing the wounds and moving forward I do believe it is possible to move forward if both partners are ready and willing to do the work to move forward together and create a new vision for their relationshipnbsp 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Yes feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy is completely normal  br  Therapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone nbsp The person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions nbsp For some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourself  br  In general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people whove faced problems similar to yours  In this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handling  No therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourself  Once you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person your nervousness will start to disappear all on its own  Good luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions

Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me     How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time, Does your husband want to listen to you  Find this out by asking him the question  This way you know whether the goal youd like to reach is even possible  Some partners prefer that one person is the rule maker or the only one who is entitled to talk about themselves  If your husband tells you he wants to listen to you or even that he does listen to you then you can explain in detail the way you define listening which may be very different than his definition  Basically no one can directly change someone into being more openminded  What is possible is to tell him your wishes your willingness to be patient while he develops the habit of listening to you and point out that a relationship is more fulfilling when both partners feel they are receiving from the other one 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, Therapy does not work overnight oftentimes it is a lifelong struggle the therapists job is not to cure you or to remove something but rather to make you strong enough to live your life with your own peculiarities and struggles remember we are human and constantly fallible Another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy that is just a room most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that roombr 
My fianc and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before He is having a hard time accepting my past especially  that Im not a virgin He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others     His insecurities are hurting our relationship How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present,This suffering and clinging to the past especially a troubled past or a past that we dont like may benbsp amplified due to the Christian framework that may be built into your life I am not averse to religion i just think that many times it puts unreasonable expectations on us and helps us to form a guilt complex or perhaps even insecurities we are humans and humans make mistakes you mention the straight and narrow this is a notion that you must give up on and let go humans can never travel the straight and narrow for their whole lives there are bounds to be mistakes we are the most fallible species on the planet and please tell your fiance to have some mercy on himself he is not perfect Here is a story about clinging on to things you may find useful to mediate onbrbrbfont facePapyrusfont size3Ofontfont size1nce  there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal  river The current of the river swept silently over them all  young and  old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing  only its own crystal selffontfontb   font size1bfont facePapyrusEach creature in its own  manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging  was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned  from birthfontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusBut one creature said  at last I am tired of clinging Though I cannot see it with my eyes  I trust that the current knows where it is going I shall let go and let  it take me where it will Clinging I shall die of boredomfontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusThe other creatures laughed  and said Fool Let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled  and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredomfontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusBut the one heeded them  not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed  by the current across the rocksfontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusYet in time as the creature  refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and  he was bruised and hurt no morefontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusAnd the creatures downstream  to whom he was a stranger cried See a miracle A creature like ourselves  yet he flies See the messiah come to save us allfontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusAnd the one carried in  the current said I am no more messiah than you The river delights to  lift us free if only we dare let go Our true work is this voyage this  adventurefontbfont    font size1bfont facePapyrusBut they cried the more  Savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again  he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a saviorfontbfont   
Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me     How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time, Its hard when you feel as if youre the only one thats taking the time to listen to your spouse But I would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you when you try and talk with your husbandnbsp  Sometimes it can be in the way dialogue is approached I would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband See if blame and criticism are present When blame and criticism are included bids for connection can quickly go off track This can sometimes start off with something like why dont you you arent you dont Partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack nbsp  Also become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband Sometimes this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another nbsp  If you find this pattern continues you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy A trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about whats happening between younbsp 
I have been married for 11 years Within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart We coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other I often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me I feel very alone and just uncared for  Is there anything I can do to feel reconnected, Feeling alone in your marriage is one of the most painful feelings Wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance thats keeping you apart can be so hurtful But change is possible You might be able to move closer toward each other on your own but since there has been two years of distance I would suggest looking into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist They are trained in helping couples begin to examine whats been happening that has caused a drift in your marriagenbsp  Im also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant If there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about couples therapy can help with this also It can provide a safe and supportive space for you bothnbsp  br 
Im obsessing about a terrible breakup Everything is a constant reminder  How do I move on, Dealing with a breakup is difficult We have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives First it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss If we dont allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on So in some ways you dont want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings Instead take good care of yourself talk to friends and give your self time to heal The second most important thing is to forgive yourself this is also an important part of taking care of yourself You might be blaming yourself and reliving moments when you wish you would have done things differently By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck When we begin to forgive ourselves we truly begin to heal Lastly in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts This is probably the hardest part for some people but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending If you have a clear ending you can have a new beginning I hope this helps Take good care of yourselfnbsp 
Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram iMessage or snapchat people will read my messages but then they wont answer me     Could it be that there is something they dont like about me I dont understand why they wont answer my messages How do I get people to respond to me, I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list  More than likely the nonresponse has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages  Have you tried asking a question in your posts nbsp  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post  When you write nbspimagine yourself as the reader of the post  If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post  br  Good luck 
My dad doesnt like the fact that Im a boy He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me Im extreme and over dramatic    I get so depressed  because of my dads yelling He keeps asking me why I cant just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis Is this considered emotional abuse, Maybe this is emotional abuse  It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself  Maybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your gender  br  Theres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this nbspOnly then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him 
Im  very depressed How do I find someone to talk to, Great that you realize talking with a professional counselor about how you feel would be helpful  If youd like a very fast response by phone then google depression hotline for where you live nbspAnd if you have a specific topic which upsets you then google around with this topic to see if there are services specific to your interest  If youve got time to invest in looking for the best fit therapist for yourself then google therapy or therapist  There will be many many names which come up  I know I sound like I work for google only it is the easiest way to find lots of informationbr  I send you good luck  br 
What makes a healthy marriage last, I appreciate your question  The answer of what makes a good marriage are as varied as there are marriages  Basically similarity like mindedness in beliefs and values makes a good marriagenbsp  The best chance of getting along with someone on a longterm basis is when two people see life and the world in similar ways  Even though opposites attract this is a short lived dynamic which breaks apart when there arent enough similarities in common between the partners  br 
Im having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her How can I learn how to listen and get myself together, Im glad to read about your willingness to develop new ways to invest yourself with your partner  The easier way to fix a relationship is when both people are helped to recognize the ways the couple dynamic falls short of what each person would like  Couples therapy is exactly this  Still relationships can change if one person changes since changing one part of a system will change the system itself  Besides starting to work with a therapist on what you can do differently reflect within yourself on the situations when problems arise between the two of you  See if you can figure out what you wanted and what you partner wanted in that particular momentnbsp  Was one of you trying to help the other and the person felt insulted by the suggestion of needing help  This is only an example of how intentions are misread or not welcome by one partner from the other  Also keep in mind there is a limit to everyones flexibility  Reflecting and selfawareness are the first step  The second step is to know when youve reached the end of possibilities to change yourself and not be accepted for who you are  This raises the question of whether the two of you are far apart in similarities in order to be happy together  Good luck in enjoying the changes you will try to make 
My wife and I got separated because I asked about her contact with a male friend of hers The next day she kicked me out  She let me move back two days later Yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind I asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business, When threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners And if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationshipnbsp  From the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship Avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship If your wife is willing I would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time Or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option nbsp 
Ive only been married three months Every week we argue about something and it seems to be getting worse, One key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument When couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forwardnbsp  Im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over If youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it Once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about 30 minutes The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  span stylefontstyle italicwhen things are good between youspan  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time That way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time Rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needsnbsp 
My exwife married and used me to have a child She now uses that child as a pawn I know my child misses me but I need to move on and not live in the past How do I do this Do I see my child as much as possible or very little Is it more confusing for the child, I am really glad you reached out When parents get divorced they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child We might divorce our partners however we dont divorce our children If anything our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives Unfortunately in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and I am hearing that may be happening in your relationshipnbsp  You can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child It is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child It is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you For example if you and your ex dont have a parenting schedule it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for you when you will see your child but your child can know when you will be available just for her This will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled times  I would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your childs life How you can both be there to help raise her If this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court There are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist you  Remember in any discussion keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right direction  Best of luck to you 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this, It takes a lot of courage to go to therapynbsp I have gone myself as a Counselor and know what that feeling is like This is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist This might be something to bring up to your Therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxietynbsp If it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for youbr 
I was raped a couple months ago Since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred I have been having trouble feeling emotions Its almost as if Im a sociopath lacking any feeling What can I do to change this, First and foremost be gentle and patient with yourself It is normal to feel a range of emotions after a severe trauma including no emotions at all Try not to push yourself to feel just notice the lack of emotion you are experiencing right now Maybe write about your emotions and the lack of them or talk about it with a safe person Unfortunately recovering from trauma can take time and its best done at your own pace If you arent feeling there may be a reason you arent feeling For severe trauma I always recommend working with a trained trauma professional who has the training to guide you on your path to healing fully 
Im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me     How do I get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time, Thanks for reaching out This is a great question Communication is definitely a 2way street One person cannot participate in a discussion It takes a talker and a listener Furthermore communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying nbspsince I cant ask you questions about what is going on I am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when I work with couples One person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner nbspThis can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heard  I understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you That can be really frustrating and difficult and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship  One of the best strategies to gettting heard is actually to BE A GOOD LISTENER to someone else I know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive right You want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills In other words you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later onnbsp  Here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach ulliPay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation No texting or distractions Lean in FocusliliListen for content and for emotion Clarify what you dont understand Try to understand the persons underlying emotionsnbspliliDont rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going onnbspliliEncourage the other person to continue speaking Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are sayingliliAsk questions to get to understand the other persons point of viewbrliuldivI believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills and the other person feels heard they will be more likely to listen to us If you dont find that this doesnt spill over in that way then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it If there is push back from him set up a trial period to just try the skill perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps If communication is really breaking down then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skillsbrdivdivbrdivdivBest of luck to youdiv
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, Its completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them nbspWhen you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things nbspSome people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did nbspOthers would be upset nbspIf your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend then you need to talk about it nbspEach of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect nbspThen you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship nbspMaybe he wouldnt be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend nbspOr maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him nbspMost likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward nbsp  You didnt do anything wrong because it doesnt sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend nbspBut if you really care about your boyfriend then you probably care about making him upset nbspInstead of looking at this issue as a problem try to look at it as an opportunity to connect nbspIf you can both listen to each other and understand each other your relationship can become even closer 
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, Thank you for submitting this question I think this type of situation can be common for many couples struggling with how to keep friendships with past relationships while being in a new relationshipnbsp  For me more information is needed herebut given the information provided the way I interpret the question isIm assuming your boyfriend didnt know you were going to spend the weekend with your good friend nbsp  Working off of this assumption I would suggest beginning an open and honest dialogue with your boyfriend about what specifically upset him And to talk about your point of view regarding spending the weekend with him I would also suggest talking about how you both envision your relationship when it comes to spending time with othersnbsp  If you feel like you cant have this conversation without it going off track please consider seeing a couples therapist They can help you begin these important conversations that can help shape and develop the relationship you and your boyfriend long for nbsp 
I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out     How can I approach them about it should I hold back and keep it a secret or should I just be upfront about it  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy  What should I do, Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it  Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it  Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life nbspUsually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us  Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing nbspBased on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them  Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time nbsp The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome 
I dont know how else to explain it All I can say is that I feel empty I feel nothing  How do I stop feeling this way, Your question is very broad because feeling empty can develop for many different reasons  Youre certainly not alone in feeling this way  Try to follow the logic of your feelings by asking yourself questions about the empty feeling nbsp Doing this may open up a discovery about the reason for the emptiness feeling  When do you feel empty are there certain situations it happens more often than another what helps the feeling go away what or who is helpful in relieving the empty feeling  Sometimes people need a little help to get started in understanding how to recognize their feelings  Consider a therapist any disciplined practice which encourages selfknowledge such as some yoga practices and a creative discipline like photography or musicnbsp  As long as you concentrate on increasing your selfunderstanding eventually youll find the answer to your question 
People who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so It makes me feel like Im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me I have had jobs but I am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong Any time I bring these things up I am expected to be over the issue These are people that you cant just cut out but I have never received apologies for so much of my pain I dont know what to do any more I dont know who I am anymore, Hello Adults who come from abusive home histories physical emotional or even psychological may take a long time to heal from that abuse We carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts This is often easier said than done but it is possible From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us  however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needednbsp  Those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions  even in the worst of cases They themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before How are they behaving toward you now Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isnt dependent on an apology from an offender By forgiving even in the absence of any apology we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process Talking with someone who can be nonjudgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healingbr  Warm regards  Shawn Berthel MS LMHCbr  br  br 
Ive been going through a rough time lately I been into nothing but women Ive never thought about men until a week ago Im very upset and depressed about this Its not normal to me I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that Im not gay I get the same results each time and I feel disgust This is tough on me Im scared that I looked too many times I keep thinking about it and shake all the time, Hello Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be can be emotionally disturbing and quite unsettling It creates anxiety maybe even panic and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys or if you desire them to be intimate with you It is important to know what impact this has on you because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex I am not going to pass judgment on you either way  even for having the thoughts I have worked with the lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer LGBTQ community in various ways over the years Many I speak to say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually Maybe you are bisexual and dont have an exclusive attraction to the same sex You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area to explore the feelings and issues around this topic Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too Running from your feelings is not a good idea and others in a support group for sexuality issues might be able to relate to you and what youre going through right now This will offer you perspective as you think on how this plays out in your life  Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now I encourage you to consider reaching out for help You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor nor of having feelings of same sex attraction If you decide you are indeed gay then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling There is a huge community of support for you Additionally we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings and help you come to terms with them more directly I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life No matter what do not fear being yourself Againyou are not alone I promise  br  Warm regards  Shawn Berthel MS LMHC 
Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather  How can I fight this, Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood  in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp to boost your dose of vitamin D when the sun isnt naturally out Also consider what is it that the change in weather changes in your life If for example when its sunny you are an outdoorsy active person and when the weather changes youre whole activity level changes along with it you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months 
Ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky  Is this normal Should I still be feeling like this,Therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life So I think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics That said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you

Im  very depressed How do I find someone to talk to, Hang in there Feeling depressed sucks but talking with someone can really help  so its awesome that youre already trying to figure out how to find that person Tons of good suggestions already but to add my two cents  you can find therapists in your area and read a little bit about them to find someone you like the sound of via this website and also via wwwpsychologytodaycom if you have health insurance your insurer might be able to make recommendations as to therapists covered by your plan or if you happen to be in school the school itself should be able to connect you with either their own counselor or a center that they recommend nearby Finding someone can take a few calls or a bit of research so if you need some immediate support or find yourself having thoughts of hurting yourself you can also call the great folks who run the Suicide crisis linenbsphttpssuicidepreventionlifelineorg  they are great in moments of crisis 
Im dealing with an illness that will never go away and I feel like my life will never change for the better I feel alone and that i have no one     How can I overcome this pain and learn to be happy alone, Im so sorry youre feeling like things will never get better Try to remember that whatever illness you are dealing with you are not the only person to have dealt with it and you are not alone Out there just waiting for you is a group of people that will totally understand what youre going through and will be able to share how they coped Try searching for a support group for your illness  google and wwwpsychologytodaycom are both good places to start for those groups 
I need help knowing how to deal with stress What can I do,Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles  so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed So that means taking slower fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles Check out meditation apps such as Breathe which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise I recommend using the app daily whether you feel stressed or not and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress  that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calmwish and itll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone    My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules She is trying to control my life What should I do, Youre among many millennials who live with their parents due to financial reasons  Does your mother mean rules pertaining to the way your family household organizes its daily or does she mean something else  Every household needs rules as responsibilities to keep the house clean who does the grocery shopping the way costs are distributed for this and all the other carrying charges nbspand tasks of maintaining the house in decent order as well as respecting the privacy and noise level requests of others who live in the home  This set of responsibilities applies whenever more than one person lives with another person  Have you tried simply telling your mom that youre willing to be a responsible household member and that you prefer to keep the details of the way you live the rest of your life to yourself  This would show respect to your mom and start the discussion as to the areas of your life you feel deserve privacy and how you would like to handle when your right to run your own life overlaps with any household duties

Im concerned about My 12 year old daughter     About a month or two ago she started walking on her toes as well as coloring and writing very messy This all happened very suddenly She has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly     Is this something I should be concerned abou Any advice will help, Have you asked your daughter why shes doing the behaviors you describe  Often the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reason  Her answer will give you some guidance as to next possible steps  If shes pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problem  Ask if shes noticed any change in the way she walks nbspnbsp  Maybe she doesnt know shes doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you shes doing something a bit odd  Since usually 12 year olds dont color is it new that she started coloring  Maybe given the fact of messy handwriting shes in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young child  Then this becomes the topic of examination  Does she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescence  Some of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughters motivation nbspnbsp  br 
A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection     Now Im In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent  This is causing major problems for my ego and its diminishing my self esteem This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage     I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to     What could be causing this and what can I do about it, First step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attention  If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself  Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it  If you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt nbspIf she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herself  There may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem  Medicine looks for symptoms to treat  Our emotional lives are much more indirect  If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex life  Basically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same  br  You may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away 
I need help dealing with stress How can I handle it all and feel less stressed out, In case you feel some relief to know youre feeling the tone of our times  We live with crumbling of our values which then gives rise to insecurity everywhere nbspIf someone doesnt know what their values are then its difficult to do anything and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptions  Youre more normal for noticing and feeling stressed than if you imagine life felt fine the way it is  One road to take is to accept that there are no clear roads forward nbspThis means to change long term goals into shorter ones  Also in general the more focused you can be as to your particular wishes motivations interests and people about whom you care the greater will be your sense of confidence that your personal world is as secure as it can be for right now  And it helps too to know that nothing lasts forever eventually all of what is up in the air will start to land in a much more clear way 
I know I need to deal with my depression But I dont know how and I dont want to tell anyone     How can I deal with depression without telling anyone, It can be really tough to tell someone  anyone  that youre feeling depressed But finding that supportive person that you can share with is a big part of the battle with depression Depression thrives on being secret it seems to grow the more we isolate ourselves and hide it away so Im with Laura Cassidy when she suggests finding that professional support person so you can start fighting back against your depression If that feels like too big a step right now maybe check out a book or two Im a big fan of a book called Feeling Good by Dr David Burns if you want some practical thoughts on tackling depression and on Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach if you prefer something a little more spiritual

I need help dealing with stress How can I handle it all and feel less stressed out, Part of handling stress is making sure that your perception of the stress is accurate Sometimes stress can seem more than it really is One thing that I encourage my clients to do is to ask themselves What is this stressor really about Simplifying stress is a key to minimizing stress and leads to feeling less stressed out 
I dont know how else to explain it All I can say is that I feel empty I feel nothing  How do I stop feeling this way, A feeling of emptiness can be from a lack of awareness and acknowledgment for the things the people the places that you have in your life The use of affirmation and gratitudes helps to remind ourselves of all of the aspects of our lives

Does counseling really do anything that can help people, Hello Yes counseling can be beneficial to many people One of the effective components to effective therapy is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling I dont mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 4550 minutes but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place This requires you to be vulnerable capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable Therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly honestly and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals  your improvement of self It does take time and there are no quick fixes usually so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places Youll thank yourself later knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process Be well 
Does counseling really do anything that can help people,I love this question Some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldnt need a counselor However if you are having a difficult time counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on tracknbspdivbrdivdivCounseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know For one your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do In that way counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation This gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings A counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotionsnbspdivdivbrdivdivOver time as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights The work you do is based on you and where you are at Oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you A counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your plandivdivbrdivdivBest of luck to youdiv

I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, Ideally you and your boyfriend will reach a balance point where you and your boyfriend are each happy with the level of involvement you have with your former boyfriend  Start w a discussion with your current boyfriend as to what specifically he doesnt like about your friendship with your former boyfriend  It is possible that you can answer his concerns as well he can find out from you more as to what the friendship is all about  As a therapist Ive never seen a former romantic relationship become only a friendship nbsp As sincere as you may be in your intention to only keep the friendship with the former relationship partner if nbspyour former boyfriend secretly has romantic feelings for you then at best youve got an unclear friendship with this person  The obvious possibility is to socialize together with your current boyfriend and your former one If neither guy would go for this then this would show there is an undercurrent of competition for your romantic attention  Basically make your romantic partners feelings and your own the major considerations and discuss from this perspective 
Im dealing with imposter syndrome in graduate school  I know that by all accounts I am a phenomenal graduate student and that I am wellpublished  I am well liked by students and faculty alike  And yet I cannot shake the feeling that Im going to be found out as a fraud     How can I get over this feeling, First step is to remove the label of your behavior as a syndrome and instead understand the reasons for it  Imposter syndrome sounds like a name someone made up to write a book and have lots of people buy it bc it gives the feeling they know themselves by calling themselves this name  Instead consider your own unique qualities including your fears of being recognized as adding value to peoples lives  If you were told growing up that youre worthless or if your chosen career goes against family advice and expectations or if you simply are a shy person then these would be the starting points to understand your reluctance to believe in yourself  The more you understand yourself and trust the truths you find as to who you are the less you will feel fraudulent  Good luck in your career work 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, From the very beginning of counseling sessions I emphasize that the work will and must end at some point  In counseling there is an arc to the process A beginning middle and endnbsp  I am always digging searching and exploring  nbspThere comes a point where things come to there natural ending  I always leave an opening for continuing counseling in the future At least as a check in 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision Here are a few examplesnbsp  The counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer Beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issuesnbsp  Another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit No counselor is the right person to work with everyone If the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in sessionnbsp  The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on While this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end However counselors know that this is part of the process They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move intonbsp  All of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor nbspfollows throughnbsp 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, This is a question that is very specific to each person There are definitely some variables but I can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end ulliWhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorliliSometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timeliliSometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication This depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement If the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyliul Im not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment Oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things Changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning I strongly encourage you to ask about it 
How does a person start the counseling process, Usually people call me by phone they introduce themselves we chat for a bit then we schedule a time for their appointment 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, Hi therenbsp  There are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship nbspThe last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed nbspAll of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last examplenbsp  Your question however was about the counselor ending treatment This is a bit more difficult and can be very nervewracking nbspIt may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well nbspIts important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something else  In regular openended sessions I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently In these checkins I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely nbspI also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize nbspIn goaloriented sessions I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goalnbsp  Often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy nbspThis is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you Often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery That said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these upnbsp  In the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you Its a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managednbsp  I hope that this brief response can assist you going forward 
How does a person start the counseling process, Hellonbsp  There are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone nbspIts most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of reliefnbsp  My recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment Listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away You may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for you  Regardless of how you go about it I like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back There are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits younbsp  br 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated  1 Client has met therapy goals  2 Client is not progressingnbsp  3 Therapist is not a good fit for client  In order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals When a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse preventionnbsp  When a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client In these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea 
Im in my late teens and live with my dad  The only time I go out is for my college classes Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks     Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right    Are they right am I depressed, Im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself From the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth All of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depressionnbsp  Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the futurenbsp  I do hope that you will reach out Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we neednbspbr 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, Hello The end of the counselorclient relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement Counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons Among them are the clients inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinicians inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere In this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the clients inability to pay That is traditionally seen as an unethical practice Other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramount  When the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important This transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journeyrather than some abrupt departure from it An abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist Sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished In this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolution  I have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that I learned years ago during graduate school Not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist It is perhaps one of the most important guiding views I hold in working with clients The therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality  the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapists desire to truly see the client heal and grow When there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form Or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward In these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate Usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clear  Ultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere If both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set Eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the clients successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter 
How does a person start the counseling process, Hello Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help That said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesnt have to stay that way Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way The counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth  Once you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet That first session is often very low key There might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement This document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details All of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor  In the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous Heres a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins Counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor Its true We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us What makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like were standing on a three legged stool This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client Counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes Coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work togethernbsp  Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers We honestly do not plain and simple Counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education Yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return Very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life So as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy 
Im dating this guy Peter My friend Jennifer used to date him a while ago and shes fine with us dating My exboyfriend Paul broke up with Jennifer and shes devastated about it Peter and I are going through a rough patch in our relationship All of a sudden Paul is in love with me and he wants me back I dont know what to do because I cant hurt my friend or my boyfriend but I think I might Paul again, Hello The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return Is the person afraid of being alone Are they jealous of your current relationship Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended How long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner Does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead Some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflection  You likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen Other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance How it will it impact your current relationship  Going into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness Ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm No one else can make this choice for you However gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist In your heart you will likely find the right answer Learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it Use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too The answer will arrive if you let it

I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out     How can I approach them about it should I hold back and keep it a secret or should I just be upfront about it  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy  What should I do, Thanks for asking this question I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy For that reason I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy  As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret I dont really think that its necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet In other words one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after youve known each other for a couple of meetings The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose thisnbsp  It sounds like this is an important part of you so I would think that if you were going to date someone longterm you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including that  I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdress  Id also ask you to consider this Are the people who you say this to expecting it My guess is that the answer is probably not Along with that Are they going to have questions I would imagine so  Are you comfortable answering questions  I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questions ulliWhat exactly is crossdressingliliDoes that change the gender that youre attracted toliliWhat does it mean to youliliWhy is it important to youliliAnd what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressingliul There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship  I certainly hope that you find the right person for you I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, Hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions Its really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions Sometimes however a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselors expertise Thats a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of nbsphow best to meet them whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider 
My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10 She then started to act younger than she is     Now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age I dont know why this is happening Is this normal, Good for you to know your daughters friendship circles and to notice when these have changed  While friendships are key relationships they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normally  Is your observation and opinion that your daughter isnt normal based on other factors or just this one  br  If this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kids  Has she ben ostracized or bullied by her peers and may be retreating to avoid further emotional hurt  Is she keeping up with her school work  Sometimes kids who feel overwhelmed by schoolwork will regress into conditions in which they feel more success and control  Are there family circumstances such as the death of someone with whom your daughter felt close nbsp  Or is there a new younger sibling in the family or a younger sibling who due to their own circumstance receives more attention than your daughter may wish for herself  br  Once youve reflected on which areas may be affecting your daughter gently ask her some questions about her comfort with what you theorize may be the source of the problem  Its also possible that offering her your extra time and interest may increase her sense of self so that she feels secure enough to increase her social time with her age group 
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates, Great question which I imagine many other people have as well  The therapist will want to know your main source of life discomfort nbspIn what areas are the problem interactions which you hope will disappear  The therapist is trained to listen for your emotions to your story nbsp  And to open these up to you in a kind and safe way so that youll start to see your circumstance in a new light in which you feel more of your own authority to handle the troubling conditions  The therapist and you will refine your thinking and theories nbspnbsp  The therapist will ask questions to help you prepare for any stumbling blocks along your way of creating your own new answers to the problem you brought to counseling  I hope youll enjoy learning and creating new thinking and interacting patterns 
I am in a high stress position for a tech company I am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety but also demoralizing    What can I do to manage my stress, Recognize your reason for continuing to work for this place  Sometimes overworked and underpaid is tolerable bc of the valuable learning which the person will take with them when theyve decided the time has come for these lessons to end  Or are you in this place bc it is an easy commute to your home or fits well with other parts of your life such as education or some health related program  As long as you have a good reason to be there you will feel there is good purpose  If there is no good purpose and every day you wake up to work for a place you cant stand then its time to look for a new position 
My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him  I also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people    How can I feel more comfortable around other people, Probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your life  Have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through nbsp It is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questions  Also understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship nbsp Given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time the way you socialize will change  Start with one person whom youre pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your life  As a result of how this interaction goes how you decide to spend your time together what youll discuss you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other people  Then you can consider if youre ready to add others into your world 
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have, To be nonjudgemental know who they themselves are be able to step forward and ask questions with ease and grace into painful emotional areas  Also to respect human difference in accomplishing basic life tasks and everyday livingnbsp 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, In my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patient  Otherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonment  The way youll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easily  The persons mood will be better they will smile more sit in their seat in a more relaxed way look more at ease take better care of their appearance  One of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessions  Sometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks then monthly then every three months  This gives a sense of security friendliness and casualness to the therapy and demedicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one day  Talk therapy is about life and life problems usually end gradually  I end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time 
How does a person start the counseling process, Phone or email a counselor whose profile youve read and which feels right for you  Ask to get a feel as to the way the person would handle your problem and work with you  In my practice I offer a phone consult which generally continues for twenty minutes  I feel it is only fair that a prospective patient has a feel for the service they are about to purchase before they can be expected to pay money for a service which may not be to their liking at all  br 
I dont understand why this is happening Why do I feel this way, The first step to answer your question is to reflect on what is going on in your life overall nbsp  If youre in the midst of severe stress whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship upheaval in family dynamics some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changes  I assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoors  What you write sounds like youre not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times together  One way to encourage yourself to go back outdoors is to connect w a friend or search for an interest within you to develop  This way with either of these youd feel a little bit of motivation to join and get more involved with either of these  br 
Im in my late teens and live with my dad  The only time I go out is for my college classes Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks     Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right    Are they right am I depressed, The answer to the question of whether or not youre depressed is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your life  Otherwise people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what theyd like to do with their lives and accept depression as though it is their new name  What you write sounds like classic depression  What to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way nbsp  Assume that what you do in daily living is somehow necessary nbspUnless you are doing immoral or illegal actions to other people to accept your own wishes as truth will open you to appreciate why you do what you do  Make believe youre interesting and find out more about who you are if you have trouble to start with thinking of yourself as worth understanding  The more you appreciate who you are and your unique strengths vulnerabilities and fears the more these will dissolve by what seems on their own  In fact they will disappear bc you are believing in yourself and your ways  Good luck 
Im in my late teens and live with my dad  The only time I go out is for my college classes Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks     Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right    Are they right am I depressed, Hello Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily We look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth If that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd Heres a secret that might help with most of those issues Not much of those problems Ive just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers I can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another persons suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years  When we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress whos popular whos not popular and for the most of it all of that is external So the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal That is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes In your post you mentioned that you live with your dad Are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression Finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy It is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause It is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourself  Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so Do you have a friend who is your best friendsomeone who is there for you no matter what If not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors They are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful Its called Teen Line httpsteenlineonlineorg It helped me when I was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling You might also check with your school for assistance  Dont be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel Adults dont always have a handle on it either Being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty But you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it I wish for you the very best and bright futurenbsp 
I have a relative who is in his twenties  He was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again No one informed family that he was using drugs again  He subsequently overdosed and was found dead  Is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed Is there a legal case for failing to report, I am so sorry for your loss nbspGenerally therapists only have a duty to report self harm to ones self or others if it is expressed to them nbspOften times they will not report relapses due to the fact that proper releases were not signed or patient has specifically asked them not to for fear of shaming or failure again nbspI understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for nbspI would encourage the family to seek therapy themselves for help coping with such a lossnbsp  br 
My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this A while back 3 years ago I asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed I caught him one night drinking behind my back I confronted him and he lied but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again Lately my husband has been drinking on and off but I noticed it was every single night I didnt like this For our New Years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption He was on boardno more drinking every night  The other night I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing It took a couple of days but tonight I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but I couldnt wait I asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and I cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking He slurred a bit and said no I asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no I went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch   Im not sure if Im overreacting or not I just feel like Im so honest with him about everything and I expect the same honesty He is a good husband in every other regard, It can be very frustrating being lied to nbspThe one thing that struck me was the sentence he had a alcohol addiction in the past nbspAddiction is not something that comes and goes nbspOnce you have addict tendencies they are here to stay nbspYou may be able to fight them off for awhile but the will enviably rear their ugly head again nbspSome of the things that we would suggest is taking the access away nbspIf the alcohol is not conveniently in the house he would have to go seek it out elsewhere nbspYou can think about it in other terms nbspIf chocolate cake was your favorite food and you were a diabetic you would not have chocolate cake lying around all the time because you know you would eventually eat it nbspRemember there are no temporary addicts 
I have bipolar II disorder Im addicted to alcohol and weed and Im hopeless I keep drinking even though its harming myself and others, You are not hopeless as you can see there are many people who care about your well being and believe you can overcome this nbspI would suggest that you first get evaluated for your alcohol consumption nbspAlcohol is one of the addictions that you may need to seek inpatient treatment for nbspIf not inpatient then be monitored by a doctor nbspOnce you are evaluated and or complete inpatient treatment I would suggest you participate in a form of outpatient therapy on a consistent basis nbsp 
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately, There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately nbspMany of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee nbspI would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help younbsp 
Or how to send him somewhere that can help him something like The Baker Act, Your dad needs to be aware that he has a problem and be willing to make some changes in order for him to be motivated to stop nbspOften times individuals will be forced to stop when they were not ready nbspRemember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do nbspThere needs to be at least a little willingness on the other party to make some changes nbspI would encourage you to reach out to your family or other loved ones and have a conversation with your dad regarding your concernsnbsp 
Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental    I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction, It can be challenging to quite anything once we set our mind to it nbspWe often crave the things more that we know we can not or should not have nbspWith that being said I would encourage you to become aware of the chemical dependency part that cigarettes have on your brain and your body nbspThen make yourself aware of the mental part the habit part nbspOften times people will engage in smoking again just from the mere social aspect of it nbspMake yourself aware of these and devise a plan of the things you will do instead of going out on smoke breaks or the ritual of smoking in the car on on the back porch nbspThere are plenty of support groups out there to help with this as well nbspSmoking cessation is a good resource nbsp 
My son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and I stopped working so that I could take care of him  I also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally Now I live like a recluse and I always feel nervous around people    How can I feel more comfortable around other people, I would look at nbspgetting engaged with a support network of individuals who may also have autistic children nbspThey will understand some of the things that you are experiencing at home and you may also find someone who feels that same way as you If you have not sought professional counseling for the abusive relationship I would seek out a therapist who can help you process through it so you do not repeat similar choices in your next relationshipnbsp 
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates, A good therapist will discuss what brought you to therapy in the first place and devise a therapy plan with you on some of the things that you may want to work on nbspThe plan is not set in stone as things may arise during your therapy sessions You also agree on how often and when you would like to meetnbsp 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, In the best case scenario its a mutual discussion and decision If not nbspIve had the discussion initiated both ways by me when I sense the client has gone has far as they want by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments missing or cancelling appointments usually at the last minute lack of participation during sessions nbspClient initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments by forgetting their calendar or their checkbook   by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals once a week to once a month for example nbspI rarely have had to terminate a working relationshipthats why I dont charge for the first visit so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together nbspThen I periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress moving in the right direction talking about the most relevant issues etc

My exfianc whom I am still seeing left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom his exgirlfriend of 20 years He and I split three months ago but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his exgirlfriend and kids He is coexisting for the kids and fighting all the time with his exgirlfriend His daughters dont want their dad with me because my two boys grown adults and on their own now had bad reputations and issues with drugs His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to do the right thing and stay with his exgirlfriend for the kids He says he wants me to wait We were going get married last year He bought me a 1000 dress we had invitations made and everything set up but then his girls told him theyd never speak to him again if he married me He says hes trying to mend his relationship with them, Hello It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you Do you feel those circumstances are healthy Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty Why do you continue to be in this situation Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you Is there a benefit to being in this relationship Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional In truth only you can decide the answers to these very important questions I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive In my clinical view based on what I read this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person  Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose It likely will only lower your selfesteem There is a time to wait to see how things develop and a time to move on to other experiences You are the one to make that choice but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self for the most clear answer Chances are you already know the answer you just need to embrace it Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here

Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental    I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction, Quitting smoking can be difficult Its also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way From the way that you wrote this it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically but still have cravings  One thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or OBGYN about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings Sometimes that can very helpful  As far as the more emotional or mental piece these things come to mind ulliSometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy There are sometimes toys like those available at Office Playground that may help to keep you physically occupiedliliThere can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead The list is endless but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise with the permission of your doctor just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well completing a puzzle learning a new activity that requires using your hands painting or knitting perhapsliliAnother piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes perhaps irritability Depending on what it is that you may be feeling nbsplearning other strategies to use can be helpful as wellliliThis can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change I would recommend that if things do not become easier for you consider talking with a therapist Then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to doliul I give you a lot of credit

Im planning to have baby so I have to quit smoking  but its hard Sometimes its not a physical need its mental    I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking What can I do to get rid of this addiction, It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop  Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance  Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up nbsp  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke  Or do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke  Also since youre planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke feel less intense  Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking nbsp With AA groups a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink nbspnbsp  Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations nbspMaybe it will help you to stop smoking  br  Good luck 
Im a teenager and Ive been sneaking out of my house at night for a year now Ive been caught several times  I want to stop doing this but I dont know where to start How do I stop, Where do you go and what is your reason to go wherever this is  Try to understand these reasons because the answers may give you good guidance as to other ways to get what nbsp it is your trying to reach by sneaking from your home at night  If for example youre sneaking out because your parents are arguing and you feel hurt by this and want to escape hearing their arguments then you can come up with other ways to hear less of their arguments  If you sneak out bc your parents restrict your friends or time to socialize with your friends and your friends are doing legal and safe behaviors then maybe you could do some socializing online w them  Also I wonder the reason why either of your parents isnt aware that you leave the house nbspDo you feel your parent would offer and would you ask your parent to give their suggestions so you feel more motivated to stay home 
I keep having these random thoughts that I dont want  Things like you arent worth anything  I know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it    What is wrong with me and how can I stop having these thoughts, Those nbspcritical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you at a very young age  When we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us feels accurate we absorb their opinions as our own  Your question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinions  Nothing is wrong with you everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of view  Start the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel true  Then replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your own  After a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, Counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist Even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit And the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not It is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, There are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling nbspA major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client nbspThis may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time nbspIf the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy nbspThe process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities nbspAnother reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care nbspIf the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care nbspIn this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit nbspA third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship nbspFor example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship nbspIn this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist nbspFinally if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment the clinician and client should terminate treatment 
What are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client, Each counselor will have their own list of difficulties in doing therapy work with a client nbspEven if clinically trained similarly since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humans  On my list is when the emotional pain I feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another feels very deep  Sometimes I feel like avoiding the pain I feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks about  What in fact is necessary to clear out their pain is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain isnt greater than who they are 
Does counseling really do anything that can help people, Yes counseling can help people  How this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding  Also a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someones strong emotions overwhelm them  This is different than in everyday circumstances nbspWhen someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone elses feelings there is no one who asks reflective questions  Last people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, I will work with clients and continually review progress with them and determine if counseling is helpingnbsp If a client appears to have less to talk about in sessions appears more stable for a period of time and has reached therapeutic goals I will talk about terminationnbsp Some clients however I may continue with on a monthly or bi monthly process to allow for checkins to see how they are doing and if they need more help at that timebr

After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates, After meeting a client many Counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for This assessment is required by most insurances and allows the Counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the Counselor If you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many Counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us The better we understand what it is that bothers you what you would like to get out of the counseling and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals How the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the Counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling and that information is too much for this little post 
I start counselingtherapy in a few days Im freaking out but my main fear is that Ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about, Many people cry during their therapy sessions Actually most people cry in their therapists office I tell my clients that its safe to cry in my office and crying isnt a sign of weakness Its a normal human response to pain People actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying Crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many peoplebr 
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client, In general I usually let the client decide when this should occur sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels In short therapy ends when you feel your done  Cbr 
Ive been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it I havent been diagnosed with depression but i have been extremely sad for years    How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers wont help, To be bullied is very painful  Im glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness  Depending on how independent you feel why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal  Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe  If you hesitate to do this on your own then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school to report the problem  In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help  Youre entitled to be protected by your school 
I need help knowing how to deal with stress What can I do, Something different works for each of us  There are the outward answers of selfpampering and making your home and work environment as pleasant as possible  A deeper level way to decrease stress is through exercise or alternative practices like yoga or tai chi  If the stress is more deeply rooted than temporarily feeling irritated for a few days then give yourself some time to reflect and clarify what the meaning of the stress is to you  Selfunderstanding and appreciating your efforts to know yourself may decrease stress because youll be more focused and attentive to who you are nbspThis will influence you overall to make good decisions for yourself and these will naturally be ones which decrease stress as much as possible 
Ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young  I sometimes still do it but I dont exactly know why     I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now Ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I dont know how to stop or even why Im doing it     How can I help myself to change my behavior, Hello I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you In other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it Yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances Do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior Do you feel good after you have done it The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury If none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your side  When we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated No closer to solving the issue When we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us  Sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity  Reach out if you need helpthere will likely be a hand there waiting for you 
Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather  How can I fight this, One theory is that instead of fighting your feelings accept your sad feelings and work with them nbsp Feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadness  Also I believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed nbsp Winter for most creatures is a time of withdrawal and slowdown nbspOur bodies and moods are part of nature as well nbspFighting what is part of nature seems like a tiring fight which the person will lose  Last point there are the winter holidays to break up the dark and cold of winter nbsp Maybe you can invent some of your own winter celebrations so youll have a few gatherings to look forward to hosting 
Ive never been able to talk with my parents My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager I love both of them but not their personalities I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life If my dad doesnt believe me then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either Im a pansexual but I cant trust my own parents  Ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me I feel that my friends dont listen to me I know they have their own problems which I do my best to help with But they dont always try to help me with mine when I really need them I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust, Life sounds extremely frustrating for you right now  As long as youve reached your conclusion that your parents do not take you seriously when you would like to speak with them on a serious topic and that you feel unable to trust either of them then work with your own information  Many people dont know how to listen and arent trustworthy nbspAs painful and aggravating as having parents who fit this description youre better off to honor what you realize than to continue fighting what is not in your hands to change  Since you write about having a similar problem with friends then maybe this comes about because you pick friends who are similarly unsatisfying to be with as are your parents  The first step out of this dilemma would be to accept how crummy you feel about the way your parents are toward you  If youre able to live with the sadness and resentment of having parents who dont want to know how to understand you then youll start to develop a new and more satisfying definition of what you expect from the behaviors of your friends  Trust yourself that what you feel and see is accurate then it becomes easier to trust and welcome new people who are formatted differently than either your parents or your friends who sound very similar to your parents ways

Im a female in my mid 20s  Lately I tend to over drink and Ive become a very angry drunk     In the past I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol     But now even if I dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking I dont understand why Im feeling this way Does this mean I have a problem, Speaking with a licensed therapist will help you figure out if indeed you have a problem or not nbspI would say the first question you should ask yourself is why you are drinking The second would be why you feel the need to drink in excess It may be due to a life event or the crowd you are running with nbspEither way a therapist will be able to help you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult timenbsp  br 
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant  I dont know what to do to fix the relationship, I would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been or more importantly you have felt that he is nbspThis will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyones perception can be different Remember that relationships take work and take communication 
How does a person start the counseling process, I think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time nbspYou need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need nbspTo many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to reengage nbspRemembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so I would treat it as such Do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help younbsp 
My brother has been a heroin addict for years and hes now in his mid30s He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents Hes sick in the head Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us Today my mom and my brother went toetotoe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my moms face I feel terrible but hes always picking his girlfriend over us Mind you he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend hes single and shes only living here because he feels bad We tried kicking them out and everything but nothing is working They do nothing to try and help, I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation nbspIt can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted nbspIt is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself nbspOther individuals need to take the same accountability nbspEnabling often happens in households with addiction It can be a challenging environment to live in nbsp 
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone    My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules She is trying to control my life What should I do, Unfortunately I think most of us have heard this so you are not alone nbspIf you are still under her roof she has leverage as to what her expectations are while you are living there nbspI would consider therapy for the both of you to see if there could be a middle ground that could be agreed upon nbspOften times a 3rd party can help with conflict nbspIf there is no resolution then I would look to get creative in finding a place of your ownnbsp 
I have three children a biological daughter a stepdaughter and a stepson I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today My daughter blames me I told her to stay out of it Im scared of all three kids now They all blame me for their choices they made All three have drug addictions I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on, Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms nbspIt is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us nbspYou can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden nbspWe are all in charge of the choices we make nbspNo one makes us do something other than our self nbspWe choose how we internalize and react to situations nbspI would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward nbsp 
Shes my stepmom Im pretty sure shes illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad, I would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom nbspUsually there are other signs of use that can often be missed nbspBe aware of behavior changes and mood swings nbspBe supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for helpnbsp 
I recently lost a friend to suicide  Im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it How can I handle this better, First I am so sorry for your loss nbspMost people go through the grieving process nbspI would get a better understanding of what that process is nbspEveryone has their own way of handling loss nbspYou are taking the first step in realizing that you are having a difficult time coping with it nbspI would reach out to a therapist that has experience treatment patients with loss I would also recognize that drinking and smoking are both substances that will not make depression or depressive thoughts any better nbsp 
My friend is abusing her prescription medicine Even though she told me she didnt have any more pills I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications, Your friend needs to admit they have a problem nbspIf not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more nbspIt is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested nbspIn other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them nbspLike anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways nbspI would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation nbspEncourage her to get help and let her know you re there for hernbsp 
My boyfriend and I recently broke up One week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space He completely deleted me out of his life He does have an opiate addiction He claimed he was sober but since weve split Ive heard many lies from him Could he be using again and does this addiction affect the mind, Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well nbspI would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns nbspNot only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals nbspBeing more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationshipsnbsp 
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, The most important thing to ask yourself here is how did this action affect my relationship and is it worth the consequences Regardless of your intentions in this action your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior From here we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as is worth harming the relationship you currently have It is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes Many times it just gives the wrong impressions It is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer and truth be told they kind of are The best intimate relationships are friendships first and foremostnbsp  br  It is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend If you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend then it is very likely youre involved in some emotional infidelity When we turn to others instead of our partner it is as if we ran into another persons arms instead of theirs No matter who you are that hurtsnbsp 
Im in my late teens and live with my dad  The only time I go out is for my college classes Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them but sometimes I wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks     Sometimes I feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right    Are they right am I depressed, Although some people managing depression feel sad or down nbspitnbspis a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood nbspMany people indicate that they feel numb or flat nbspPeople managing depression often have low motivationnbspThey may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities nbspPeople with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame nbsp If you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks I recommend that you see a counselor to get a more indepthnbspevaluation nbsp The symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression and with a bit of support you could regain energy and improved selfesteem nbspThe stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a labelnbspof depression seem scary nbspThe important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders nbsp nbspHang in there nbspHealing is possiblenbsp 
How does a person start the counseling process, Approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first but most mental health professionals want to help you feel safe and heard nbspYou can often find counselors using search engines like CounselChat or Psychology Today nbspThese websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step nbspThese days counselors have websites where you can learn even more nbspThese websites usually have clear instructions for contact nbspTypically you can reach out via phone or email to request a consultation nbspDuring a consultation call you can ask the therapist questions about their credentials and areas of expertise nbspIf you feel like you connect you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy nbspThe thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them and they are happy to be approached for support nbspGood luck nbsp

How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy Now that theyre gone I feel sad Its been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent, Hello So someone made you happy but is no longer around I am sure that feels devastating As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life Happiness is formed within ourselves All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary Even relationships fo not last forever If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problem  What I would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself What do you like about your life as it is right now What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event Mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent It is a path to healing and moving forward From this you can seek out new sources of happiness I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw If you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply  I wish you happiness for every day of your life  Best wishes 
What am I doing wrong My wife and I are fighting all the time What can I do We dont agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions which are usually wrong on how I feel She is very familyoriented while all of my family left me on my butt abused ignored and messed up with me mentally Im not a familyoriented person I only have two people in my life  my best friend and my wife      My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is Weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him  This makes me mad because I dont want to look like my mother I hate her All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless which she was successful at  I need guidance in my life  I dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy Im dying to make our relationship healthy Ive never wanted anything more than this Please help me I need your advice, Hello It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now Marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent There are no easy answers to your questions and I wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections First and foremost cut yourself some slack No one is perfect We fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow Yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor Seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach You have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respects  Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful You can find these through local counseling resources Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful If you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you  Lastly parents are imperfect Yepits true They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage We limp along and do our best Having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life Both with ourselves and toward other people So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit nbspI am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it If only one of you cares then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person Thats not fair So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution All of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life One way or the other you will benefit from it  Be well

How does a person start the counseling process, The easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online A quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful There are lots of Counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that Check out their website social media and any reviews but remember people are not always very nice If you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network You can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurances website If your coverage isnt that great and you know youre going to be paying for it all anyway because youre an allstar and verified your coverage already with the insurance company then you can really pick any Counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible If you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once youve started counseling a hrefhttpsgetbetterco targetblankBettera is a good option Once youve found a Counselor you think is a good fit for you normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment With many Counselors you can now send an email but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic Once youre all scheduled they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there From there all you have to do is show up

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,For a therapist deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision One that is not entered into lightlynbspdivbrdivdivWhile there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question Ill offer an example of two areas that counselors take into consideration when ending counseling sessionsulliDoes the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide This requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is neededliliAnd has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goalsnbspliul While this question is specific to the counselor Id like to also add that span stylefontweight bolda client at any time can end counselingspan div

I dont remember when the voices in my head started but I remember Hearing them when I was little     I know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own I fight the voices and I want them to stop  Theyve been here so long and I want them gone How can I make the voices stop, How is your life going overall  Since you hear voices since you were young I wonder whether you mean the thoughts each of us has about what to do our opinions including selfcriticism and praise  I try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if youve managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voices  Usually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychotic  Since this is going on for a number of years I wonder if the problem is something different 
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, Hello There are a number of factors playing into this situation A former romantic partner coming back onto the scene during a current relationship you spending alone time and spending the night with that former partner and the uneasy feelings experienced by your current partner boyfriend Now those are the ones you have openly expressed There are very likely other issues that prompted this behavior on your part You ask if you were wrong It is not a question I will be able to answer because it is not one I am meant to answer It is up to you to find that truth Now if you are feeling guilty was it because of some sexual engagement occurred when you spent the night If so you might want to look at why that happened Do you feel secure in your current relationship Is this the relationship you want or do you want to be with the former boyfriend  Important questions but ones you need to ask and answer Odds are there is something that triggered this event to occur and it becomes a focal point in discovering any unexplored discomfort or other issues with your current boyfriend Seeking relationship counseling can be effective in sorting this out so be open to that possibility to help you clarify your thoughts and feelings  Best of luck to you

How does a person start the counseling process, I always suggest that you find the right fit You have every right to interview the therapist and ask as many questions as you need It is our job as a therapist to explain our approach and philosophy This gives you a good overview of the therapist Just call and say that you would like to talk to the therapist Say your interested in the services but unclear about how the process works From there a seasoned therapist should be proficient in helping to guide you through the process with ease and comfortnbsp  a hrefwwwlifecounselingorlandocomwwwlifecounselingorlandocoma 
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone    My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules She is trying to control my life What should I do, Unfortunately you seem to have yourself in a double bind By living with your mom she is not going to stop her attempts at what you perceive as controlling There is no use in trying to debate or get her to see your point As long as your there and you personalize her attempts at control then you will find yourself frustrated and resentful Try to find an extra job or a roommate so that you can do the natural process of moving on out  a hrefwwwlifecounselingorlandocomwwwlifecounselingorlandocoma 
I feel so alone I have so many people around me but it seems as they just listen and dont understand  They say it will all be okay or they dont listen to me st all  Everyone says they are here for me but it doesnt feel like they are Why do I feel so alone, We feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self When you find that nobody is around do you feel alone Your never alone Once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you there will never be an alone momentnbsp  We seek outside of self to fill inside This is the big lie of the planet All you need and have ever needed you supply yourselfnbsp  a hrefwwwlifecounselingorlandocomwwwlifecounselingorlandocoma 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years Ive been really sad lately and for the past few months Ive realized Im just way too dependent on him   It makes me really upset to be so dependent on someone else but I cant help it I dont even know who I am without him    How can I be less dependent on my him, From what you write youve got good motivation to change and awareness as to what youd like to changenbsp  These are very good predictors that youll be successful in what youd like to change  Try the next time you realize youre depending on your bf instead of friends yourself to interrupt whatever typical action youd take  Do something different instead  If when youd like advice and usually ask your bf ask a different trusted someone  Or when you feel lonely contact a friend or introspect on your own if usually youd contact your bf  br  Also being dependent on a bf is part of a trusting intimate relationship nbsp Dependency in the sense that you each are reliably available to each other is a good quality  Only if it seems excessive such as youre isolating yourself from other close friendships is dependency on a partner a problem 
My fianc and I have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good The only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me     I recently found out he cheated on me with another women  He says he wants his family back but Im confused on what to do  Is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on, Definitely yes it is possible for a couple to trust each other again and become close with each other  Since your trust was broken your fianc would need to earn back your belief that he is faithful to you  Do you feel he empathizes with how you felt to find out about his cheating  Before you have this question answered based on what you write there is a sense of your own doubt as to whether you are with the right partner  Before you and he address regaining your trust first decide if youd like to work on this  Ask yourself if the sexual attention he felt he wasnt getting from you was bc youre not as interested in him as you imagine or once felt in the past  If each of you sincerely wants to be together it is possible to talk about your respective needs and help the other person feel safe again with the other 
Im dealing with an illness that will never go away and I feel like my life will never change for the better I feel alone and that i have no one     How can I overcome this pain and learn to be happy alone, Is it possible that even though your illness is chronic that it goes through phases in which you are more comfortable and that it requires less focus from you than at other times  I think the idea of having a lifelong illness is frustrating and can be depressing to think about nbsp  Thoughts are not necessarily the truth of what will actually happen though  Illness makes negative situations look worse so be sure you are concentrating on specific areas of your life and not just assuming they will work out badly because you are ill  One way to be happy alone is to love and appreciate nurture and be kind to yourself  This frame of mind may generate new answers to find ways of being among other people too 
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates, Each counselor may have a different process so Im not the end all authority here nbspFor myself I review policies and confidentiality concerns with people first and answer any questions they havenbsp  Then Ill let them know Ill be writing a lot in this session and I have an assessment form that I like to get completed but I want to have a conversation and Ill ask questions as we go nbspMy first question is usually How do you feel I can best help you today nbspSome people are very at ease and tell me many details nbspOthers are a bit more reserved and I have to demonstrate more curiosity nbsp  Even people who have been very apprehensive are usually feeling very relaxed by the time the session is over nbspUsually when we get close to end of session time Ill summarize what I think are the biggest concerns from what Ive heard and confirm whether or not the person wants to work on those things nbspI also try to give an exercise targetting my biggest concern for them to work on in between sessions nbspFor instance a relaxation method if they are very anxious nbsp  Counselors are just humans as well so it does take a bit of time to really get to know another person nbspI always tell people that are apprehensive to give the counselor 3 or 4 sessions to determine if they really connect with them nbsp  I hope that helpsnbsp  Allisonnbsp 
I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it but I dont know how What can I do, Your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are than you realize nbsp Fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of them  Think about whether you felt secure and confident as a child nbspAlso did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing up  Often these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives nbspIf the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances may help you to dissolve the current fear  br  Another possibility is CBT cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe say being a passenger in a commercial airplane which feels frightening to a person  CBT is short term and results are limited to specific fears nbsp  It is a much quicker approach than selfunderstanding  br 
I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with It was brief and turned into us being just good friends    I spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend Was i wrong, While you cant be responsible for your boyfriends feelings relationships do come with expectations nbsp  Both people in a relationship bring their own expectations into it nbspThese expectations are usually unspoken but result in conflict as you are experiencing here nbspYour boyfriend expects you not to spend the weekend with this guy nbspHe may expect you not to spend the weekend with any guy at all nbspHe may expect you to spend every single weekend with him nbsp  Youll have to decide if his expectations are ones you can live with nbspRelationships do require some compromise out of concern for our partner but you get to choose how much you compromisenbsp  We get upset about things that make us feel insecure nbspYou spending the weekend with an ex makes your boyfriend feel insecure nbspThat doesnt mean you did anything wrong nbspIt just means that you have to decide if its more important for you to maintain your freedom to spend weekends with whomever you wish or to help your boyfriend feel secure in your relationshipnbsp  Good luck nbspHope that helps  Allisonnbsp 
I start counselingtherapy in a few days Im freaking out but my main fear is that Ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about, Lots of people do cry in session but your therapist wont be uneasy with this nbspCrying is a natural response and it also releases toxins so some might say its necessary nbspRemember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if theres something that feels too uncomfortable just say Im not ready to talk about that nbspYour counselor wants nbspyou to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place nbspAs you get to know your therapist you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them nbsp  Its normal to be anxious going into a new situation especially when you might not feel in control of uncomfortable emotions nbspDont give up go and put your best effort innbsp  Hope that helpsnbsp  Allisonnbsp 
I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out     How can I approach them about it should I hold back and keep it a secret or should I just be upfront about it  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy  What should I do, While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone it is important for you to be yourself nbspIts better to weed out 10 people who cant accept you to find that one who can nbsp 
My fianc and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before He is having a hard time accepting my past especially  that Im not a virgin He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others     His insecurities are hurting our relationship How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present, You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue nbspYou cannot change that for him nbspHe will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own nbsp  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible but always recognizing that you cant fix this for him nbsp  When I work with people who struggle with their partners past experiences I always frame it like this nbspEverything that youve experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today nbspThe person they claim to love nbspIf you had not gone through some of those experiences you would not be in the position youre in now ready to commit to him and know that youre satisfied with that nbsp  Just as when bad things happen to us we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that youre the person you are today because of what you have gone through nbspCelebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him  Hope that helpsnbsp  Allisonnbsp

How does a person start the counseling process, First identify the areas that you need help with What are the issues that are most troubling you Are these situations creating an impact on your daily routine  Second do some research as to the type of counselling service you are looking and that would best suit your needs Are you looking for individual sesssions couplesfamily sessions etc And research potential therapists in your area that focus their counselling approach on your therapeutic needsnbsp  Third contact the therapist most dont answer the phones so leave a message or send an email Dont be affraid to ask questions You want to make sure that this professional is a good match for you and will work with you at working toward your therapeutic goals the things you want to addresswork on during the sessions  Fourth have the expectation that depending on the issues you will need multiple sessionsappointments with the therapist to really address the issues and work toward your therapeutic goals  It takes strength and courage to reach out for help but I know you can reach your goals It takes time patience and practice do really address your needsnbsp  Good luck 
I love my girlfriend so much I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her  But the two times we tried to have sex I couldnt get an erection  Weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago     Why this is happening and what can I do about it, Im sorry to hear of your problem  First step as always when a possible medical explanation exists go for a urology check up to either your internist or a urologist  Once you know there is no medical reason which would prevent an erection then we can consider the psychological and emotion based factors  Maybe youre nervous about your sexual performance or that your gf may be disappointed in your performance  Men often mistake their own fears of performance failure with the assumption that their partner thinks about sex as a performance  Talk with your gf about whatever is on your mind which may inhibit you from enjoying sex  The reasons are endless  What matters is to have a heartfelt dialogue with each other  The emotional support which comes through such an intimate conversation may very well be the catalyst for a more relaxed and satisfying approach to sex w your gf 
I know I need to deal with my depression But I dont know how and I dont want to tell anyone     How can I deal with depression without telling anyone, Love yourself more and treat yourself kindly with empathy and compassion  Usually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated nbspSince at this time you wouldnt want to tell anyone about the way you feel which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support give this to yourself  Also consider to make a goal of eventually telling someone whom you are reasonably sure would understand and empathize about your depression  This will help alleviate the sense of shame unworthiness and pervasive guilt which often comes along with depression  Sending you good luck 
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed She told me that she wants to move What can I do to help her  I want her to stay, People often have very different values and opinions when they are drinking excessively and when they stop drinking so much  Did the two of you share drinking as an activity nbspIf yes then did you stop drinking too  Often when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober the relationship ends nbspOnce the terms of any relationship changes one possibility is that it dissolves  The best way to go is to start the conversation of what you genuinely want nbspThis is the only way shell really know your thoughts  Ask her to give serious consideration and discussion over at least a few weeks or months to moving away from you nbspThis is a fair request since you are in a relationship  If shes changed so much by giving up drinking which is possible that she no longer wants to be in relationship to you then you are better off being without a drinking gf even if the truth she delivers is a hurtful one  br 
I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I cant afford to live alone    My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules She is trying to control my life What should I do,Hello Even though legally you are an adult it is a matter of courtesy to respect the homes of your parents As long as you live there you should be considerate of their needs At the same time there should be conversation about what each of you considers appropriate as it pertains to communication between a parent and an adult even though you are still her offspring This will require openness honesty and a willingness to give from both sides in a respectful way Healthy boundaries can be established and honored when each is willing to do their part in this new relationship Your mother knows you are an adult but has not had as many years of treating you like one So mentally and emotionally this will take some time for her to adapt Share your concerns with her and see if you can come up with a set of rules that you both can honor It will be a great stepping stone for both of you as you move into this new chapter together as you begin relating a little differentlydivbrdivdivReach out for help to a counselor if needed You dont have to sort this out on your own And lastly take good care of yourself in the process You are moving through some exciting times in your life The more you can have support as you explore new events the better you might feel less stresseddivdivbrdivdivWarm regardsdiv
Our relationship ended about 7 years ago but dont know how to let go How can I get over that person and move on, What youre most likely trying to get over is to be attracted to the qualities which you felt attracted to in the person  The problem isnt releasing yourself from the person per se nbsp Letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you value  Two possibilities exist  Either you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and youd like to base your next relationship on these qualities  Or the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship ended  It is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationship  See if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a couple  If you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life youll attract a partner who has similar qualities  Basically people attract what they need  The more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner the more likely your next partner will have these qualities  In this way youll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationshipnbspbr 
My husband and I had our first threesome recently Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me     He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now Im craving more of it But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling Why am I feeling this way, Because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationship  Try to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband 
I have PTSD The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex anger and my relationships  I even lost my job month ago     How can I get my life back, Slowly is the rate at which youll get back your life  Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life  Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life  It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost  Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health nbspWith this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships  When you feel angry try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress fear insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry nbsp Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity  Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle youll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others 
After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,There are probably no two therapists alike because first and foremost we are human beingsbrAndour personalities may somewhat guide how we go about getting to know you identifying what you would like to be different in your life and developing a plan to get where you would like to be The very most important thing that will determine a successful outcome is the healthy therapeutic relationship between you and your therapistnbsp If you dont feel safe comfortable and ready to work together then it is likely not a good fit brAnd thats OKspeak up and the therapist should assist you in finding someone you can readily work withbr

I want to live with my mom My dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault I still talk to my mom although My dad tells me that Im no allowed to Im scared I will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me     How do I tell him that I want to live with my mom, Yes from what you wrote your dad doesnt accept responsibility for the way he feels and blames you for his feelings  Im glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young child  I also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishes  Your decision is not surprising since most people wouldnt want to live with a parent who shows little interest to respect their kids decisions  In terms of how to tell him your choice do this in simple and most basic information terms nbsp Ive decided for now to live w mom  I suggest to not offer reasons to him bc he doesnt seem interested in hearing them nbsp Giving him reasons would likely trigger him to rebut them  If he asks questions answer them as simply as possible  If and when you feel he is more willing to understand and know you then youd feel more free to have genuine dialogue with him  Right now he doesnt seem very ready to handle this 
We rent from from my boyfriends parents His father drops by unannounced and stays for long periods of time He lets himself into our home when we arent there on a daily basis and takes our dogs to his house He picks up our mail He has NO boundaries     Hes an opinionated rude pushy person He expects to spend every weekend around us gives unsolicited advice on child rearing and does not respect our privacy at all He barges in with no warning He has a key and lets himself into our house without asking permission I need help How do I address this, Youre expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriends father  Since the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the father  If your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then great  If your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe here  If all else fails then a new living space is always another possibilitynbsp 
My dad makes me feel like shit and like Im worthless  He calls me names and makes me feel depressed  I want to move out because I swear if I stay here Im going to lose it What can I do, If youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life then this is a reasonable choice  If youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from him  Doing so is much more difficult than maybe it sounds  Do you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dad  Also limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize you  Are there other people who live in the household w you and dad  If yes then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by himnbsp  What do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you names  Is it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behavior  If yes then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name calling  It is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stop  Not necessarily that he will stop nbspKnowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own

After first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates, Hi nbspThis is an excellent question  nbsp I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist  nbspIn my work with people  once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the persona concerns and the issues they want help with  I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the clients current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress  nbspI would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track nbspWe would then discuss the best plan to address the clients concerns  nbspUsually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful  nbsp I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this nbspI tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they wont try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me nbspI want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful nbspstrategies I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and dont like  agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan  nbspWe the nbsp work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful  but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along nbsp If things arent improving  I am very happy and willing to try something new nbsp  I hope this is helpful for you nbsp

My exwife married and used me to have a child She now uses that child as a pawn I know my child misses me but I need to move on and not live in the past How do I do this Do I see my child as much as possible or very little Is it more confusing for the child, The thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life Children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong Because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks its their faultnbsp  As hard as that already is for a child it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life This makes the belief even more strong for them They start to think why does dad keep leaving What am I doing to keep making him go away  I believe a child needs both parents in their life Whether she used you for a child or not that child still exists and never asked for this They didnt ask to be born into drama and two parents that cant make things worknbsp  You can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child If you start over far away this may mean less visits but youll still be a part of their life Just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it Every child deserves that muchnbsp  Good luck to you  
My grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink Barbie backpack as a form of punishment, Absolutely notnbsp  It is never in a childs best interest to use humiliation as punishment This can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the childs social relationships Kids have a hard enough time To then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionablenbsp  The entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful healthy adult You do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake Discipline shouldnt be seen as punishment It should be seen as a way to teach a lesson What lesson could this possibility be teaching him Absolutely nothingnbsp  Meanwhile she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactionsnbsp  She should be one of the people he can come to when hes hurting not someone who causes him pain 
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant  I dont know what to do to fix the relationship, Im sorry you have tension between you and your bf  A relationship means two people who relate right nbsp If only one person does all the work to change their approach what they expect what they offer the other then this becomes the new problem to solve  If youve already done a significant amount of reflection and change in the way you relate to him then the next step may be to be patient as long as possible while he decides what to change about his part in the relationship toward you  Substance abuse recovery requires profound effort and reflection nbspIf it is successful then the result will show very different qualities in your bf than the ones you know currently  He may be so absorbed in the recovery that he can only concentrate on this nbspnbsp  Of course if the fights persist and you have been patient for what feels too long then there are different questions to address
