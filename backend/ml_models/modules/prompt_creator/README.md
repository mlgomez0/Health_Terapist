This module contains a list of initial prompts that can be used as input for text generation tasks,
such as generating responses using a pre-trained language model or in our project to collect users answers.

This module looks to carefully crafted to elicit relevant information and guide the conversation in a therapeutic direction:

1.	**Identify key areas and topics**: Determine the main areas and topics you want to cover in your mental health counseling sessions. These could include anxiety, depression, stress management, relationship issues, trauma, etc.

4.	**Personalize prompts**: Tailor prompts to the specific needs and circumstances of each client. This can be done by incorporating information gathered during the initial assessment or previous sessions.
5.	**Provide context**: Include contextual information in the prompts to help the RAG model better understand the client's situation and provide more relevant responses.
